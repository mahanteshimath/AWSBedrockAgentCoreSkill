# Deploying Strands Agents - Lambda, Fargate/ECS, EKS

> **August 2026 refresh:** Framework deployment on AgentCore Runtime should pick the compute path intentionally: serverless runtime, direct code deploy, or Runtime Instances for capacity-provider/GPU/long-session requirements. For direct code deploy, prefer current supported runtimes (Python 3.13/3.14 or Node.js 22 for new builds) and avoid deprecated Python versions. _Sources: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/release-notes.html, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime-code-deploy-supported-runtimes.html_

## Overview

Strands Agents SDK (open source, AWS, **GA since May 2026**) supports four main AWS deployment targets:

1. **AWS Lambda** - serverless, no native response streaming. Handler-based, with official Lambda Layers for easy packaging.
2. **AWS Fargate / ECS** - container-based with HTTP streaming via `stream_async()`, FastAPI + Docker, CDK-managed.
3. **Amazon EKS** - Kubernetes with EKS Auto Mode and Pod Identity for Bedrock access; Helm chart provided in the strands-agents/docs GitHub repo.
4. **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime** - microVM-isolated sessions, GA in 16 regions (including GovCloud US-West), recommended production target in 2026. For full AgentCore Runtime coverage, see `agentcore-runtime.md`; for IaC details, see `deployment-iac.md`.

**Maturity:**
- AgentCore Runtime: **GA** in 16 regions. Container and direct code deployment supported. WebSocket bidirectional: **GA**.
- AgentCore Harness: re-check current GA/Region availability in `freshness-2026-08.md` and live release notes.
- Managed Session Storage (AgentCore Runtime): **Preview**.
- Lambda / Fargate / EKS deployment patterns: **consolidated and stable**.
- AgentCore CLI (`@aws/agentcore` npm): **GA**, CDK supported, Terraform coming.
- `strands.experimental.bidi` namespace streaming: **Experimental** (distinct from AgentCore Runtime WebSocket which is GA).
- Strands Agents SDK v1.0: **GA** (May 2026), with session management, async, multi-agent support.

The standard architectural pattern is a FastAPI or `BedrockAgentCoreApp` container exposing `POST /invocations` and `GET /ping` on port 8080. `BedrockModel` internally uses the Bedrock Converse API (`ConverseStream` / `Converse`), not the legacy `InvokeModel` API.

---

## Key concepts

### Architecture: monolith vs microservices

A Strands agent can be deployed as a monolith (agent loop + tool execution in the same environment) or as microservices (agent invokes tools via API in a separate backend). Five main patterns:
1. Local / CLI
2. API deployment on Lambda / Fargate / EKS
3. Isolated tools with a separate backend
4. Multi-agent orchestration
5. Managed AgentCore Runtime / Harness

### BedrockModel - Converse API (not legacy InvokeModel)

`BedrockModel` internally uses the Bedrock Converse API (`ConverseStream` for streaming, `Converse` for non-streaming). IAM actions required: `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream` (for streaming) and `bedrock:InvokeModel` (for non-streaming). Constructor parameters: `model_id`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`, `streaming` (default `True`), `guardrail_id`, `cache_config`, `boto_session`, `region_name`.

### BedrockAgentCoreApp (SDK Integration)

Class from the `bedrock-agentcore` pip package that wraps a Strands agent as an HTTP service conforming to the AgentCore Runtime contract. Exposes `/invocations` (POST) and `/ping` (GET) on port 8080. Decorators:
- `@app.entrypoint` - marks the handler function (sync or async generator for streaming)
- `@app.websocket` - handles bidirectional WebSocket on `/ws`
- `@app.ping` - custom health check handler

### AgentCore Runtime Service Contract

Every container on AgentCore Runtime must expose:
- `POST /invocations` port 8080 (main handler)
- `GET /ping` port 8080 (health check - must return `{status: 'Healthy'|'HealthyBusy', time_of_last_update: <unix_timestamp>}`)
- Optional: `GET/WebSocket /ws` port 8080 for bidirectional streaming

Required platform: **linux/arm64**. Supported protocols: HTTP (port 8080), MCP (port 8000), A2A (port 9000), AG-UI (port 8080), WebSocket (port 8080 path `/ws`). Images stored in ECR.

### Session isolation with microVM

In AgentCore Runtime, each user session runs in a dedicated microVM with 2 vCPU / 8 GB memory and isolated filesystem. After termination the microVM is deallocated and memory sanitized. `runtimeSessionId`: if omitted on the first invoke, AgentCore generates it automatically; if provided by the client, must be at least 33 characters. AgentCore does **not** enforce user-to-session mapping - the client backend is responsible for managing this relationship.

### Session Lifecycle in AgentCore Runtime

Three states: **Active** (processing sync requests, commands, or background tasks), **Idle** (complete but available), **Stopped** (microVM terminated due to inactivity, max lifetime, explicit stop, or unhealthy status). When Stopped, the session remains valid and the next invoke creates a new microVM. `idleRuntimeSessionTimeout` and `maxLifetime` are configurable via `LifecycleConfiguration` (range 60-28800 seconds, defaults 900s and 28800s). `InvokeAgentRuntimeCommand` executes deterministic shell commands on the same agent session.

### Async Task Management in AgentCore Runtime

For long tasks: `app.add_async_task(name, metadata)` returns a `task_id`. `app.complete_async_task(task_id)` marks it complete. The `/ping` returns `HealthyBusy` while tasks are active, preventing idle timeout. Alternative: `@app.ping` with custom logic returning `PingStatus.HEALTHY` or `PingStatus.HEALTHY_BUSY`. Sync request timeout: 15 minutes (not modifiable); async job max: 8 hours; streaming max: 60 minutes.

### stream_async() - Async HTTP streaming

Primary method for streaming on Fargate / EKS / AgentCore. Returns an async generator of events. For FastAPI: return `StreamingResponse(generate(), media_type='text/plain')`. **Not natively supported on Lambda**. Events include: `init_event_loop`, `start_event_loop`, `message`, `result`, `force_stop`, `current_tool_use`, `data`. On AgentCore Runtime, `@app.entrypoint async def` + `yield` enables HTTP streaming (max 60 minutes).

### WebSocket bidirectional in AgentCore Runtime (GA)

**GA feature.** `@app.websocket` decorator handles persistent WebSocket connections on port 8080 path `/ws`. Authentication: SigV4 headers, SigV4 presigned URL, or OAuth 2.0. boto3 API: `InvokeAgentRuntimeWithWebSocketStream` (25 TPS, adjustable). Max frame size: 64 KB; max rate: 250 fps per connection. Client uses `AgentCoreRuntimeClient.generate_ws_connection()` or `generate_presigned_url()`. Ideal for real-time voice agents and AG-UI streaming.

### SlidingWindowConversationManager

Context manager that limits conversation history to a fixed number of messages (`window_size`). Essential in production to prevent context window overflow and reduce token costs. Usage: `Agent(conversation_manager=SlidingWindowConversationManager(window_size=10))`. Default Agent retry strategy: `max_attempts=6`, `initial_delay=4s`, `max_delay=240s` (configurable via `retry_strategy` or disabled with `None`).

### SessionManager - Session persistence

Strands abstraction for persisting state and conversation history. Built-in options:
- `FileSessionManager` - local filesystem (development/testing)
- `S3SessionManager` - S3 bucket (distributed production)

In multi-agent setups, **only the orchestrator** (Graph/Swarm) must have a session manager, never individual internal agents. Distinct from AgentCore Runtime session persistence (which manages the microVM filesystem, not conversation history).

### Lambda Layer official Strands

ARN pattern: `arn:aws:lambda:{region}:856699698935:layer:strands-agents-py{python_version}-{architecture}:{layer_version}`

- AWS Account: `856699698935`
- Python versions: 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- Architectures: `x86_64`, `aarch64`
- Layer Version 2 = strands-agents v1.40.0

### AgentCore CLI (`agentcore`)

npm tool (`@aws/agentcore`) for scaffolding, local development, and deployment to AgentCore Runtime. Commands: `agentcore create` (wizard), `agentcore dev` (local), `agentcore deploy` (AWS), `agentcore invoke` (test). Supports both container deployment and direct code deploy (zip). Generates `agentcore.json` and `aws-targets.json`. Available in 14 regions. CDK supported; Terraform coming. Replaces the old `bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit`.

### AgentCore Harness

Managed agent loop fully managed, powered by Strands Agents. Configuration: model + system prompt + tools (inline or via AgentCore Gateway/MCP). Handles orchestration, tool execution, memory, identity, VPC networking, observability. Supports Amazon Bedrock, OpenAI, Gemini, and mid-session provider switch. Stateful by default: isolated microVM per session, persistent filesystem, integrated AgentCore Memory. Re-check current Region availability in live docs before deployment. No additional cost (only pay for underlying AgentCore capabilities). Harness invocations share AgentCore Runtime quotas.

### Managed Session Storage vs BYO Filesystem (AgentCore Runtime)

Two categories for filesystem persistence in the AgentCore Runtime container:

- **Managed Session Storage (Preview):** per-session isolated, no VPC required, survives stop/resume, 14-day idle expiry, resets on version update, max 1 GB.
- **BYO (Amazon S3 Files or Amazon EFS):** shared between sessions/agents, VPC mandatory, permanent until explicit deletion.

Up to 5 total configurations per agent runtime. Mount path required: pattern `/mnt/<subdir>`. Configured via `filesystemConfigurations` in `CreateAgentRuntime`.

### EKS Pod Identity for Bedrock

On EKS Auto Mode, access to Bedrock is configured via Amazon EKS Pod Identity, associating an IAM Role to a Kubernetes ServiceAccount. On EKS Auto Mode this is natively integrated (Pod Identity Agent add-on not required separately). The official strands-agents/docs repo on GitHub contains the ServiceAccount YAML and complete ClusterRoleBinding for the Helm deploy.

### AgentCore Runtime - Versioning and Endpoints

Each AgentCore Runtime update creates a new immutable Version (complete config snapshot). The `DEFAULT` endpoint is updated automatically to the latest version. Custom endpoints can be created (e.g., dev, test, prod) pointing to specific versions. Rollback = update endpoint to a previous version. Limits: 10 endpoints per agent, 1000 versions per agent.

## Best practices

- **Use AgentCore Runtime for new production deployments** - Offers session isolation with microVM (2 vCPU / 8 GB dedicated), automatic scaling to thousands of sessions, consumption-based pricing, sync execution up to 15 min (not modifiable), streaming up to 60 min, async up to 8 hours, and native integration with Memory / Gateway / Identity. GA in 16 regions including GovCloud. Immutable versioning with rollback. Recommended AWS target for production agents in 2026. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agents-tools-runtime.html_

- **Prefer Fargate / EKS over Lambda when HTTP streaming is required** - The official Lambda guide explicitly warns: "This Lambda deployment example does not implement response streaming. If you need streaming capabilities, consider using the AWS Fargate deployment approach." Lambda does not support the `stream_async()` pattern natively without specific adapters. _Source: https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/deploy/deploy_to_aws_lambda/index.md_

- **Explicitly configure the model in production with fixed parameters** - Do not rely on `BedrockModel` defaults. Specify `model_id`, `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `top_p` explicitly. `BedrockModel` internally uses the Converse API (`ConverseStream` / `Converse`). Using the cross-region inference prefix (e.g., `us.`) improves availability. _Source: https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/concepts/model-providers/amazon-bedrock/index.md_

- **Always specify an explicit list of tools in production** - Do not use auto-loading of tools. List only the tools necessary for the use case. Reduces attack surface, improves predictability, and facilitates auditing. Principle of least privilege for tools, parallel to IAM permissions. _Source: https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/deploy/operating-agents-in-production/index.md_

- **Use SlidingWindowConversationManager to control memory in production** - Without limiting history, long conversations cause context window overflow. `SlidingWindowConversationManager(window_size=10)` keeps only the last N messages. The default Agent retry strategy has `max_attempts=6`; disable it (`retry_strategy=None`) if retry logic is handled elsewhere. _Source: https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/deploy/operating-agents-in-production/index.md_

- **In multi-agent: session manager only on the orchestrator, never on individual agents** - Strands raises `ValueError` if an agent with `session_manager` is added to a `Graph` or `Swarm`. The orchestrator snapshots and restores the state of each node on each execution; an agent-level session manager would create conflicts. _Source: https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/concepts/agents/session-management/index.md_

- **Install Lambda dependencies with the correct target architecture** - For Lambda ARM64 use `--platform manylinux2014_aarch64` in `pip install`. Dependencies for the wrong architecture cause runtime errors at execution. _Source: https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/deploy/deploy_to_aws_lambda/index.md_

- **For MCP on Lambda: use context manager per invocation in multi-tenant environments** - The MCP connection must be opened and closed per invocation in multi-tenant setups. Reuse between invocations (module-level `mcp_client` with `mcp_client.start()`) is possible but risks state leakage between different users. Start with context manager and optimize only if necessary. _Source: https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/deploy/deploy_to_aws_lambda/index.md_

- **Do not perform blocking operations in the main thread in AgentCore Runtime** - The main thread also serves `/ping` health checks. If blocked, ping fails and the platform terminates the session even if work is ongoing. Use separate threading or async for long I/O-bound operations; register tasks with `app.add_async_task()`. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime-long-run.html_

- **For production AgentCore deployments: create custom IAM policies instead of BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess** - Official documentation warns that IAM policies created by the AgentCore CLI are for development/testing. For production, create custom policies with least privilege. The execution role requires: ECR (`BatchGetImage`, `GetDownloadUrlForLayer`, `GetAuthorizationToken`), CloudWatch Logs, X-Ray, and `bedrock:InvokeModel` / `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream`. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime-permissions.html_

- **Use S3SessionManager for Strands session persistence in distributed environments** - `FileSessionManager` only works on a single instance. In multi-replica Fargate or EKS environments, Strands sessions must be shared. `S3SessionManager` persists to an S3 bucket accessible from all replicas. Distinct from native AgentCore Runtime session persistence (which manages the microVM filesystem). _Source: https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/concepts/agents/session-management/index.md_

- **Fargate: desiredCount >= 2 + circuit breaker rollback + private subnets with NAT** - The reference CDK uses `desiredCount: 2` for high availability, `circuitBreaker: {rollback: true}` for automatic rollback, `assignPublicIp: false` with private subnets. `minHealthyPercent: 100` and `maxHealthyPercent: 200` ensure zero-downtime deployment. `healthCheckGracePeriod`: at least 60 seconds. _Source: https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/deploy/deploy_to_aws_fargate/index.md_

- **Container ARM64 on Fargate / EKS / AgentCore - buildx with --platform linux/arm64** - All official examples use ARM64 for ~20% lower costs compared to x86_64 and better performance for I/O-bound workloads. `docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64`. For ECR push use the `--push` flag. _Source: https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/deploy/deploy_to_bedrock_agentcore/python/index.md_

- **Separate app code and dependencies in Lambda (separate layer)** - Keep dependencies in a Lambda Layer separate from application code. Keeps application code small, visible, and editable from the Lambda console, and reduces subsequent deployments when only the code changes. _Source: https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/deploy/deploy_to_aws_lambda/index.md_

- **Configure LifecycleConfiguration to optimize cost and availability in AgentCore Runtime** - Default values (`idleTimeout=900s`, `maxLifetime=28800s`) can be adjusted via `LifecycleConfiguration` in `CreateAgentRuntime` / `UpdateAgentRuntime`. For real-time agents with short sessions, reduce `idleTimeout`. For long batch workloads, set `maxLifetime` higher. `idleRuntimeSessionTimeout` must be <= `maxLifetime`. Both in range 60-28800 seconds. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime-lifecycle-settings.html_

- **Use managed session storage for lightweight filesystem persistence on AgentCore Runtime** - Managed session storage (Preview) does not require a VPC and persists the filesystem across stop/resume. Ideal for agents that need to maintain work files, installed dependencies, or local history between sessions. Configure with `filesystemConfigurations: [{sessionStorage: {mountPath: '/mnt/workspace'}}]`. Data expires after 14 days of inactivity and is reset on every version update. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime-filesystem-configurations.html_

## Configuration reference

| Name | Description | Default / example |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `bedrock-agentcore` (Python SDK) | PyPI package required for AgentCore SDK Integration. Provides `BedrockAgentCoreApp`, decorators `@app.entrypoint`, `@app.websocket`, `@app.ping`, `add_async_task()`, `complete_async_task()`, `PingStatus`, and `AgentCoreRuntimeClient` for WebSocket client. | `pip install bedrock-agentcore` |
| `@aws/agentcore` (CLI npm) | AgentCore CLI for scaffolding, local development, and deployment. Supports container and direct code deploy. CDK supported; Terraform coming. Replaces `bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit`. Available in 14 regions. | `npm install -g @aws/agentcore` |
| Lambda timeout | Lambda execution limit. For AI agents consider at least 30 seconds; absolute Lambda maximum is 15 minutes. Agents with complex reasoning may exceed this - prefer Fargate in that case. | `Duration.seconds(30)` - increase to 60-300 for more complex agents |
| Lambda memorySize | Memory allocated to the Lambda function. More memory = proportionally more CPU. 128 MB for simple agents; 512 MB-1 GB for real agents with complex tools. | `128` (example), evaluate `512-1024` for real agents |
| Lambda architecture | Lambda CPU architecture. ARM64 (Graviton2) has ~20% lower costs and better performance for I/O-bound workloads. Requires dependencies installed for `manylinux2014_aarch64`. | `lambda.Architecture.ARM_64` (recommended) |
| Fargate task CPU/Memory | Resources allocated to the Fargate task. 256 CPU units (0.25 vCPU) and 512 MB for simple agents; increase for agents with more tools or high concurrency. | `cpu: 256, memoryLimitMiB: 512` |
| Fargate desiredCount | Number of Fargate service replicas. Minimum 2 for high availability. | `desiredCount: 2` |
| AgentCore Runtime platform | Required platform for AgentCore Runtime containers. Must be `linux/arm64`. Build with: `docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64` | `linux/arm64` (MANDATORY for container deployment) |
| AgentCore Runtime port | Port on which the application must run in the AgentCore Runtime container for all HTTP/WebSocket/AG-UI protocols. | `8080` |
| AgentCore Runtime required endpoints | AgentCore Runtime service contract: `POST /invocations` (main handler) and `GET /ping` on port 8080. `/ping` must return `{status: 'Healthy'|'HealthyBusy', time_of_last_update: <unix_timestamp>}`. WebSocket on `/ws` same port. MCP on port 8000, A2A on port 9000. | `POST /invocations`, `GET /ping` - both required. `/ws` for WebSocket. |
| `runtimeSessionId` | Session ID for AgentCore Runtime. OPTIONAL: if omitted on first invoke, AgentCore generates it automatically. If provided by the client, must have at least 33 characters. Use the same ID for all invocations correlated to a conversation. | `str(uuid.uuid4())` or omit for auto-generation |
| `LifecycleConfiguration.idleRuntimeSessionTimeout` | Timeout in seconds for idle sessions in AgentCore Runtime. Configurable via `LifecycleConfiguration` in `CreateAgentRuntime`/`UpdateAgentRuntime`. Range: 60-28800 seconds. Must be <= `maxLifetime`. | `900` (15 minutes) - increase for conversational workloads |
| `LifecycleConfiguration.maxLifetime` | Maximum duration of the microVM in seconds. Configurable. Range: 60-28800 seconds. On reaching this limit, compute is terminated but the session remains valid and recreates a new microVM on the next invoke. | `28800` (8 hours) |
| AgentCore Runtime sync request timeout | Fixed timeout (not modifiable) for synchronous requests on `InvokeAgentRuntime`. | `900` seconds (15 minutes) - fixed, not modifiable |
| AgentCore Runtime streaming timeout | Maximum duration for streaming connections (HTTP response streaming and WebSocket). | `3600` seconds (60 minutes) - fixed, not modifiable |
| AgentCore Runtime active sessions quota | Concurrent active sessions per account. Region-specific default quota, increasable via Service Quotas. | `1000` in us-east-1/us-west-2; `500` in other regions |
| AgentCore Runtime InvokeAgentRuntime TPS | Rate limit for `InvokeAgentRuntime` API. Increasable via Service Quotas. | `25 TPS` per agent per account |
| AgentCore Runtime Docker image max size | Maximum Docker image size for AgentCore Runtime. Not increasable. | `2 GB` |
| AgentCore Runtime direct code deploy max size | Maximum zip package size for direct code deployment. | `250 MB` compressed, `750 MB` uncompressed |
| Session storage filesystem mount path | Mount path for session storage or BYO filesystem in AgentCore Runtime. Must follow pattern `/mnt/<subdir>`. | `/mnt/workspace`, `/mnt/data`, `/mnt/efs` |
| Session storage idle expiry | Managed session storage data is deleted after this period of session inactivity. | `14 days` - then filesystem is reset |
| AgentCore Runtime session header (HTTP/A2A/AG-UI) | HTTP header to include in subsequent requests for routing to the same microVM (session stickiness). | `X-Amzn-Bedrock-AgentCore-Runtime-Session-Id: <session-id>` |
| AgentCore Runtime session header (MCP) | Header to include for session stickiness on MCP protocol. | `Mcp-Session-Id: <session-id>` |
| S3SessionManager IAM permissions | IAM permissions for Strands `S3SessionManager`. The agent's role must have `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, `s3:DeleteObject`, `s3:ListBucket` on the sessions bucket. | `s3:GetObject, s3:PutObject, s3:DeleteObject, s3:ListBucket` on `arn:aws:s3:::my-agent-sessions/*` |
| `SlidingWindowConversationManager` window_size | Maximum number of messages to keep in Strands conversation history. Too low loses context; too high exhausts the model's context window. | `window_size=10` (recommended in production) |
| `BedrockModel` model_id | Amazon Bedrock model ID. Use the cross-region inference prefix (e.g., `us.`) for better availability. `BedrockModel` internally uses the Converse API (`ConverseStream`/`Converse`). | `us.amazon.nova-premier-v1:0`, `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0` |
| IAM managed policy `BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess` | AWS managed policy for full AgentCore access. DO NOT use in production - create custom policies with least privilege. | Development/testing only, NOT for production |
| Lambda Layer - Strands Agents (Account ID) | Official Strands Agents layer published from AWS account `856699698935`. Layer version 2 = strands-agents v1.40.0. | `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:856699698935:layer:strands-agents-py3_12-x86_64:2` |
| Agent `retry_strategy` | Retry strategy for model calls in case of throttling or transient errors. Default: `max_attempts=6`, `initial_delay=4s`, `max_delay=240s`. Pass `None` to disable retries. | `ModelRetryStrategy(max_attempts=6)` - pass `retry_strategy=None` to disable |

---

## Gotchas

- **Lambda does not support native streaming with `stream_async()`**: the official guide states this explicitly. If streaming is needed, use Fargate, App Runner, EKS, or AgentCore Runtime.

- **AgentCore Runtime mandatorily requires**: platform `linux/arm64` (container), endpoints `POST /invocations` and `GET /ping` on port 8080. `runtimeSessionId` is optional: if omitted, AgentCore generates it automatically; if provided, it must have at least 33 characters.

- **The `/ping` in AgentCore Runtime must return `time_of_last_update`** (integer Unix timestamp). Without this field the platform may terminate the session. With `BedrockAgentCoreApp` this is handled automatically.

- **Blocking operations in the main thread of AgentCore Runtime also block the `/ping` health check**, causing the platform to terminate the session. Use separate threading or async for I/O-bound operations.

- **On Lambda, dependencies must match the target architecture.** For ARM64 use `--platform manylinux2014_aarch64`. Wrong architecture causes `ImportError` at runtime.

- **In multi-agent Strands (Graph/Swarm), a single agent with `session_manager` added to the orchestrator raises `ValueError`.** Only the orchestrator must have a session manager.

- **The old package `bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit` has been replaced by the AgentCore CLI (`@aws/agentcore` npm).** Having both installed causes conflicts.

- **IAM policies created by the AgentCore CLI are for development/testing, not production.** For production, create custom policies with least privilege for both execution role and user role.

- **`BedrockModel` uses the Converse API internally (`ConverseStream`/`Converse`), not the legacy `InvokeModel` API.** The required IAM actions remain `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream` and `bedrock:InvokeModel` (Converse API aliases).

- **Managed Session Storage in AgentCore Runtime is in Preview (not GA).** Data is reset on agent runtime version update: every `agentcore deploy` that produces a new version deletes the persistent filesystem of existing sessions.

- **AgentCore Harness maturity/Region availability changed after this June baseline.** Re-check `freshness-2026-08.md` and the live release notes. Do not confuse Harness with AgentCore Runtime.

- **The sync request timeout of AgentCore Runtime (15 minutes) is fixed and not modifiable.** `LifecycleConfiguration` only configures `idleRuntimeSessionTimeout` and `maxLifetime` (compute duration, not request timeout).

- **Direct code deployment on AgentCore Runtime has a separate quota for new sessions**: 25 TPS (vs 100 TPM for container deployment).

- **For MCP connections on Lambda**: reusing the connection between invocations (module level) risks state leakage in multi-tenant setups. The context manager is safer.

- **On Fargate with ALB, `healthCheckGracePeriod` must be set** (at least 60 seconds) to give the container time to start before health checks begin.

- **For Lambda with container image, the base image MUST be a Lambda-compatible image** (`public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.11`). For FastAPI on Lambda container use Mangum (`pip install mangum`).

- **AgentCore Runtime does not enforce user-to-session mapping**: the client backend is responsible for managing this relationship, the maximum number of sessions per user, and cleanup (`StopRuntimeSession` API).

- **EKS with Pod Identity on EKS Auto Mode: the Pod Identity Agent add-on is NOT required** (functionality is integrated). On non-Auto Mode clusters it must be installed manually as an add-on.
