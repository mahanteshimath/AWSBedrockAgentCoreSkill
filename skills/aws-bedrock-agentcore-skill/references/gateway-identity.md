# Amazon Bedrock AgentCore - Gateway & Identity

> **August 2026 refresh:** Gateway is now a broader governed AI traffic plane: use rate limits, source validation, HTTP passthrough/runtime/inference targets, Policy/Cedar, and Gateway-layer Guardrails where appropriate. For Identity, prefer Private Key JWT over shared client secrets when supported, and reuse existing Secrets Manager ARNs when enterprise governance requires it. _Sources: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway.html, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/policy.html, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/release-notes.html_

## Overview

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway and Identity are two fully managed services within the AgentCore platform. **Gateway** converts existing APIs, Lambda functions, OpenAPI/Smithy specifications, and MCP servers into MCP-compatible tools, exposing them through a single secure HTTPS endpoint with managed inbound and outbound authentication. **Identity** handles both inbound auth (who calls the agent, via IAM or JWT/OAuth from any IdP) and outbound auth (how the agent obtains credentials for external services), including a secure token vault that stores refresh tokens and access tokens.

CDK L2 constructs for both services became stable in May 2026 (aws-cdk-lib v2.255.0+); only the Policy module remains in alpha. Gateway pricing is consumption-based: $0.005/1,000 MCP invocations, $0.025/1,000 semantic search queries, $0.02/100 tools indexed/month. Identity is free when used via Runtime or Gateway; in other scenarios $0.010/1,000 token or API key requests.

**Maturity:** Gateway and Identity are **GA** since October 2025, available in 15+ AWS regions (including GovCloud US-West from May 2026, São Paulo and Canada Central from April 2026). Key GA milestones: VPC Egress for Gateway/Identity/Runtime and OBO Token Exchange (April 2026); Policy engine with Cedar and AgentCore CLI v0.4.0 (March 2026); MCP Stateful Sessions, Response Streaming, Elicitation Pass-Through, Sampling Messages, Progress/Logging Notifications (May 2026). **Preview (as of June 2026):** AgentCore Payments (Coinbase CDP / Stripe Privy), AWS Agent Registry, AgentCore Harness, Optimization Loop.

## Key concepts

### AgentCore Gateway

A fully managed service that transforms APIs, Lambda functions, OpenAPI specs, Smithy models, API Gateway stages, and MCP servers into MCP-compatible tools, exposing them on a single HTTPS endpoint. Operates in two modes:

- **MCP aggregation mode** (`protocolType=MCP`): aggregates all MCP targets into a single virtual MCP server; only MCP targets are accepted.
- **Mixed mode** (omit `protocolType`): supports both MCP and HTTP targets.

The client connects via Streamable HTTP MCP transport. The gateway runtime URL format is:

```
https://{gateway-Id}.gateway.bedrock-agentcore.{Region}.amazonaws.com
```

### Gateway Target

A target is the configuration that specifies where the gateway routes requests.

**MCP target types:**
- `lambda` - Lambda function ARN + tool schema JSON
- `apiGateway` - REST API stage + optional `toolFilters` and `toolOverrides`
- `openApiSchema` - OpenAPI 3.0/3.1 spec from S3 or inline
- `smithyModel` - Smithy model from S3
- `mcpServer` - external MCP server endpoint

**HTTP target type:**
- `agentcoreRuntime` - Runtime agent ARN for direct traffic without protocol translation

**Quotas:** max 100 targets per gateway (adjustable), max 1,000 tools per target (adjustable). Each target has `credentialProviderConfigurations` for outbound auth.

### Inbound Authorization (Gateway)

Controls who can invoke the gateway. Four modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `CUSTOM_JWT` | Validates JWT from any OIDC-compatible IdP via `discoveryUrl`. Checks `allowedAudience`, `allowedClients`, `allowedScopes`, `customClaims`. Supports claim validation operators: `EQUALS`, `CONTAINS`, `CONTAINS_ANY`. |
| `AWS_IAM` | SigV4 signing. Caller must have `bedrock-agentcore:InvokeGateway` permission. |
| `AUTHENTICATE_ONLY` | Validates JWT but delegates authorization to the downstream target. |
| `NONE` | No authentication - use only alongside a custom REQUEST interceptor Lambda. |

Supports private IdPs in VPC via VPC Lattice (managed or self-managed). When a client sends a request without a valid token, the gateway returns 401/403 with a `WWW-Authenticate` header following RFC 6750 Bearer token challenge, including required scopes and a `resource_metadata` URL.

### Outbound Authorization (Gateway Targets)

Manages how the gateway authenticates to backend targets. `credentialProviderType` values:

| Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `GATEWAY_IAM_ROLE` | SigV4 with the gateway's IAM role - default for Lambda, API GW, and Runtime targets. |
| `OAUTH` | Client credentials flow via an `OAuth2CredentialProvider` ARN. |
| `API_KEY` | API key injected into header/query/path via an `ApiKeyCredentialProvider` ARN, with `credentialLocation` set to `HEADER`, `QUERY_PARAMETER`, or `PATH`. |

### Semantic Tool Search

Optional feature enabled at gateway creation time - **cannot be changed after creation**. Adds the built-in tool `x_amz_bedrock_agentcore_search` to the MCP server. Accepts a natural-language query and returns the most relevant tools among all registered gateway tools. Configured via `protocolConfiguration.mcp.searchType=SEMANTIC`. Requires `bedrock-agentcore:SynchronizeGatewayTargets` IAM permission. Rate limit: 25 transactions per minute for search-based tool calls. Pricing: $0.025 per 1,000 search invocations.

### AgentCore Identity

Manages authentication and authorization for agents and tools. Responsibilities split:

- **Inbound auth:** controls who calls the agent (configured on Runtime/Gateway).
- **Outbound auth:** how the agent obtains credentials for external services.

Maintains a secure **token vault** storing access tokens, refresh tokens, and API keys.

**Quotas (per account per region):**
- Max 1,000 workload identities (non-adjustable)
- Max 50 OAuth2 credential providers (non-adjustable)
- Max 50 API key credential providers (non-adjustable)

**Pricing:** Free when used via AgentCore Runtime or Gateway. Standalone use: $0.010 per 1,000 token or API key requests.

### OAuth2 Credential Provider

A configuration that associates an OAuth2 client registered with an external IdP to a referenceable name in agent code. Features:

- 26 pre-configured vendors (`OAuth2CredentialProviderVendor`) plus `CustomOauth2`.
- Includes discovery URL, client ID, client secret (inline or via `clientSecretSource=EXTERNAL` referencing Secrets Manager with `clientSecretConfig.secretId`).
- Has a `callbackUrl` generated by AgentCore that **must be registered** with the IdP as an authorized Redirect URI.
- Supports OBO Token Exchange via `onBehalfOfTokenExchangeConfig`.

### Workload Access Token

An opaque token signed by AWS representing the (agent, user) pair. Authorizes the agent to access credential providers in the token vault. Runtime/Gateway generate and inject it automatically as a header when the agent is invoked with inbound auth.

For **external agents**, obtain it with:

- **Pattern 1 (production):** `get_workload_access_token(workload_name=..., user_token=jwt)` - AgentCore verifies the JWT signature, issuer, and expiration.
- **Pattern 2 (development):** `get_workload_access_token(workload_name=..., user_id=string)` - platform treats `user_id` as an opaque unverified string; security is entirely the application's responsibility.

**Important:** workload identities managed by Runtime or Gateway cannot directly retrieve workload access tokens - they receive it automatically via the injected header (error: `WorkloadIdentity is linked to a service`).

### Auth Flows (USER_FEDERATION vs M2M)

| Flow | Description |
|---|---|
| `USER_FEDERATION` (3LO / Authorization Code) | The `@requires_access_token` decorator requires human user consent; generates an authorization URL that must be opened in the browser. `on_auth_url` callback streams it to the caller. |
| `M2M` (2LO / Client Credentials) | Machine-to-machine authentication without human intervention; uses client ID and client secret directly. |
| `ON_BEHALF_OF_TOKEN_EXCHANGE` | Exchanges the inbound user token for a token scoped to a downstream resource server. Supports RFC 8693 `TOKEN_EXCHANGE` (with `actorTokenContent`: `M2M`, `AWS_IAM_ID_TOKEN_JWT`, or `NONE`) and RFC 7523 `JWT_AUTHORIZATION_GRANT`. Microsoft OBO uses `JWT_AUTHORIZATION_GRANT` natively. |

### Token Vault

Secure storage managed by Identity for access tokens, refresh tokens, and API keys. When an agent obtains user consent (3LO), the token vault stores the refresh token. On subsequent invocations, if the refresh token is still valid, Identity returns a new access token without re-prompting the user. The vault is scoped per (agent-workload, user) pair. Use `force_authentication=True` to clear the cache and force a new auth flow.

### Gateway Service Role

IAM role assumed by the gateway to invoke backend targets. Required configuration:

- **Trust policy:** `Principal=bedrock-agentcore.amazonaws.com` with condition `aws:SourceArn` scoped to the specific gateway ARN.
- **Permissions:** `lambda:InvokeFunction` for Lambda targets; `s3:GetObject` for OpenAPI/Smithy specs in S3; `execute-api:Invoke` for API Gateway targets.
- **Gateway ARN format:** `arn:${Partition}:bedrock-agentcore:${Region}:${Account}:gateway/${gateway-Id}`

Created automatically by the console/CLI or manually for customization.

### Gateway Interceptors

Lambda functions that execute custom code during every gateway invocation.

| Type | Executes | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `REQUEST` | Before the gateway calls the target | Validation, transformation, custom auth |
| `RESPONSE` | After the target's response, before returning to caller | Response transformation, filtering |

**Limits:** max 1 REQUEST and 1 RESPONSE interceptor per gateway. `passRequestHeaders` defaults to `false`; setting it to `true` exposes sensitive headers (including Authorization tokens) to the interceptor Lambda - use with caution. Primary use: pair with `authorizerType=NONE` to implement fully custom auth logic.

### Gateway Rules

Traffic routing and configuration override system that operates without redeployment. Each rule has:

- **Priority:** 1–1,000,000 (lower numbers = higher priority).
- **Conditions (optional):** `matchPrincipals` (IAM ARN matching) and/or `matchPaths` (HTTP path matching). Max 2 condition types per rule, with AND logic between types and OR logic within each type.
- **Actions:** `configurationBundle` override (`staticOverride` or `weightedOverride`) or `routeToTarget` (`staticRoute` or `weightedRoute`).

**Limits:** max 20 rules per gateway. `weightedOverride` A/B testing: the two weights must each be between 1 and 99 (0 and 100 are invalid) and must sum to 100. `matchPaths` conditions work only for gateways with HTTP targets (not MCP-only). Reserved paths (`/mcp`, `/a2a`, `/responses`, `/converse`, `/.well-known`) cannot be used in `matchPaths`.

### MCP Stateful Sessions

**GA since May 2026.** The gateway maintains stateful sessions with MCP clients (`Mcp-Session-Id` in the header). Session timeout is configurable from 1 to 8 hours (default: 1 hour). Prerequisite for:

- **Elicitation pass-through** - mid-execution user input.
- **Sampling messages** - server-initiated LLM calls.
- **Progress/Logging notifications** - human-in-the-loop features introduced in May 2026.

## Best practices

- **Use `CUSTOM_JWT` as inbound auth in production; never `NONE` without a Lambda interceptor.** `NONE` exposes the gateway to anyone without any verification. `CUSTOM_JWT` validates issuer, signature, audience, and scopes of the JWT before invoking any target. For quick-start, Cognito can be auto-created by the AgentCore CLI. Use `NONE` only when implementing a custom REQUEST Lambda interceptor for authentication. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-inbound-auth.html_

- **Scope the Service Role trust policy to the specific gateway ARN after creation.** Before creation the gateway ARN is unknown, so the `Condition` is omitted. After creation, update with `aws:SourceArn` and `aws:SourceAccount` to prevent confused deputy attacks. Gateway ARN format: `arn:${Partition}:bedrock-agentcore:${Region}:${Account}:gateway/${gateway-Id}`. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-prerequisites-permissions.html_

- **Enable semantic search (`searchType=SEMANTIC`) at gateway creation time.** Semantic search cannot be enabled after creation. With many tools, it reduces context sent to the model: instead of listing all tools, the agent searches only the relevant ones, improving latency and reducing costs. Rate limit: 25 TPM for search vs. 1,000 concurrent connections for tool-call/tool-list. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-create-api.html_

- **Prefer `GetWorkloadAccessTokenForJWT` (Pattern 1) over `GetWorkloadAccessTokenForUserId` (Pattern 2) in production.** Pattern 1 validates the JWT signature, issuer, and expiration before issuing the workload token, providing cryptographic proof of identity. Pattern 2 accepts an unverified opaque string - the risk of impersonation is entirely on the application. For workloads that always have a JWT available, also add an explicit Deny on `bedrock-agentcore:GetWorkloadAccessTokenForUserId`. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/get-workload-access-token.html_

- **Use `clientSecretSource=EXTERNAL` to reference secrets already in Secrets Manager instead of passing the secret inline.** Available for OAuth2, API key, and payment credential providers. Allows applying custom CMKs, automatic rotation, resource policies, and your own tagging strategy. Secrets remain customer-owned; AgentCore reads them at runtime without copying. Also supported for API keys (`apiKeySecretSource=EXTERNAL`) and payment providers (`apiKeySecretSource`, `walletSecretSource`, `appSecretSource`, `authorizationPrivateKeySource`). _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/resource-providers.html_

- **Prefix `userId` with the provider name when using multiple IdPs with `GetWorkloadAccessTokenForUserId`.** Two users with the same `sub` from different IdPs (e.g., `cognito+user123` vs `auth0+user123`) would otherwise occupy the same slot in the token vault, causing cross-contamination of credentials. This is an explicit security requirement in the documentation. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/get-workload-access-token.html_

- **Include the provider-specific refresh token scope in the first token request.** The token vault stores the refresh token automatically only if the provider returns one. Google requires `access_type=offline`; Microsoft, Atlassian, and Slack require `offline_access` in the scope; Salesforce requires `refresh_token` in the scope. Without this, every agent invocation re-prompts the user for consent. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/identity-authentication.html_

- **Add semantically rich descriptions to Lambda tool schemas (`toolSchema`) and OpenAPI operations.** The gateway's semantic search uses tool descriptions for natural-language query matching. Vague descriptions degrade retrieval quality. The quality of semantic search depends directly on the richness of the `description` field for each tool. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-using-mcp-semantic-search.html_

- **Use VPC Egress (`privateEndpoint`) for private IdPs instead of exposing OIDC endpoints on the internet.** GA since April 2026. Gateway supports `privateEndpoint` on `customJWTAuthorizer` for IdPs in a VPC (managed Lattice or self-managed). Avoids exposing OIDC/token/JWKS endpoints on the public network. If token/JWKS endpoints use different domains from `discoveryUrl`, use `privateEndpointOverrides` (self-managed Lattice only). Requires `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` for `identity-network.bedrock-agentcore.amazonaws.com`. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-inbound-auth.html_

- **Use gateway rules for A/B testing of configuration bundles without redeployment.** GA (released Q1 2026): gateway rules with `weightedOverride` allow splitting traffic between two configuration bundle versions (each weight must be 1–99; 0 and 100 are invalid; weights must sum to 100). Max 20 rules per gateway - leave gaps between priorities (e.g., 100, 200, 300) to insert future rules without renumbering. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-rules.html_

- **Use interceptors for fine-grained access control instead of custom logic in the targets.** REQUEST interceptors execute before the gateway calls the target, allowing JWT claim validation, role-based/attribute-based access control, and returning authorization errors before consuming backend resources. Implement fail-safe defaults (deny by default), log decisions for auditing, and do not log sensitive headers when `passRequestHeaders=true`. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-fine-grained-access-control.html_

- **Use IAM policies to scope credential provider access to specific workload identities.** Explicitly specify both `workload-identity-directory/default` and the specific `workload-identity/{name}` in IAM policies for `GetResourceOauth2Token` and `GetResourceApiKey`, along with `token-vault/default`. This ensures only authorized workloads access credentials of a specific provider, preventing lateral movement between agents. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/scope-credential-provider-access.html_

## Gotchas

- **Semantic search cannot be enabled after gateway creation.** It is a one-way decision at `CreateGateway` time. Use `protocolConfiguration.mcp.searchType=SEMANTIC` in the `CreateGateway` call, or enable it via the AgentCore CLI (enabled by default with the CLI).

- **The `callbackUrl` returned by `create-oauth2-credential-provider` MUST be registered in the OAuth IdP as an authorized Redirect URI BEFORE invoking the agent.** If missing, the 3LO flow fails with an invalid `redirect_uri` error.

- **The `ISSUER_URL` for AgentCore Identity must be the full URL including `/.well-known/openid-configuration`, not just the base URL of the pool.** Correct example: `https://cognito-idp.REGION.amazonaws.com/POOL_ID/.well-known/openid-configuration`

- **Runtime-managed and Gateway-managed workload identities CANNOT retrieve workload access tokens directly.** Only unmanaged identities can. Agents on Runtime receive the token automatically in the header. Error message: `WorkloadIdentity is linked to a service and cannot retrieve an access token by the caller`.

- **The Service Role trust policy must be updated AFTER gateway creation** to add the `Condition` with `aws:SourceArn` scoped to the specific gateway ARN. Before creation, the gateway ARN is unknown.

- **With `protocolType=MCP`, the gateway operates ONLY in aggregation mode and accepts only MCP targets.** To mix MCP and HTTP targets, omit `protocolType`.

- **JWT claims are logged in CloudTrail for gateways with `CUSTOM_JWT` auth.** The entry includes the Subject (`sub` claim) of the JWT. Avoid PII in the `sub` field. Prefer GUIDs or pairwise identifiers as recommended by the OIDC spec.

- **Tokens in the vault are not guaranteed to be valid** - they can be revoked on the provider side without AgentCore knowing. On a 401 error, use `force_authentication=True` in the decorator to force a new authentication flow.

- **`GetWorkloadAccessTokenForUserId`: the platform treats `userId` as an opaque unverified string.** For workloads that always have a JWT available, add an explicit `Deny` on `bedrock-agentcore:GetWorkloadAccessTokenForUserId` in the IAM policy.

- **To access a Lambda in a different account from the gateway service role, a resource-based policy on the Lambda is also required**, in addition to the identity-based policy on the service role.

- **Creating a gateway with a private VPC IdP (`privateEndpoint`) requires `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole`** for `identity-network.bedrock-agentcore.amazonaws.com`, if the service-linked role `AWSServiceRoleForBedrockAgentCoreIdentity` does not already exist.

- **CDK constructs `aws_bedrockagentcore` (stable, from `aws-cdk-lib` v2.255.0+) and `aws_bedrock_agentcore.alpha` coexist.** The Policy module remains in alpha. Do not mix the two import namespaces.

- **The refresh token must be explicitly requested with provider-specific parameters:** `access_type=offline` for Google; `offline_access` in the scope for Microsoft, Atlassian, and Slack; `refresh_token` in the scope for Salesforce. Without this, every agent invocation re-prompts the user for consent.

- **User ID collision between different providers:** when using multiple IdPs with `GetWorkloadAccessTokenForUserId`, use the pattern `provider_id+user_id` (e.g., `cognito+user123` and `auth0+user123`) to prevent the same user ID from different providers from accessing the same tokens in the vault.

- **Gateway Rules rate limit:** max 20 rules per gateway, priorities 1–1,000,000. `matchPaths` conditions work ONLY for gateways with HTTP targets (not MCP-only). Reserved paths (`/mcp`, `/a2a`, `/responses`, `/converse`, `/.well-known`) cannot be used in `matchPaths`.

- **Interceptors: `passRequestHeaders=false` by default.** Enabling it exposes sensitive tokens (Authorization header) to the interceptor Lambda. Ensure the interceptor Lambda does NOT log these sensitive headers.

- **Identity is free when used via Runtime or Gateway** - this is a critical pricing detail. Only standalone scenarios (external agents) incur the cost of $0.010/1K tokens.
