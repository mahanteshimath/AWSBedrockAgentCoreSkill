## Part 1 - Models & Converse API

### Overview (Part 1)

Amazon Bedrock exposes two families of inference APIs on the `bedrock-runtime` service: the **Converse/ConverseStream API** (unified interface, identical across all message-capable models) and the **Invoke API** (`InvokeModel` / `InvokeModelWithResponseStream`, with a model-specific body). For conversational agents, Converse is always recommended.

The `modelId` field accepts: base model IDs, inference profile IDs/ARNs (cross-region geo or global), application inference profile ARNs, provisioned throughput ARNs, and Prompt Management prompt ARNs. Anthropic models require a one-time FTU form (`PutUseCaseForModelAccess`). Prompt caching, tool use (function calling), extended/adaptive thinking, guardrails, and streaming are all supported by the Converse API. From November 2025, four service tiers are available: Standard, Priority, Flex, and Reserved.

**Maturity:** GA for Converse, ConverseStream, InvokeModel, InvokeModelWithResponseStream, inference profiles, prompt caching (all major Anthropic Claude and Amazon Nova models). Global cross-region inference: documented GA for Claude Sonnet 4.5 (`global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0`); verify current Global-inference source regions and supported models per individual model card. Service tiers Priority and Flex: GA November 2025. Reserved tier: GA November 2025. Adaptive thinking (Claude Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.7, Claude Mythos Preview): GA 2026. `InvokeModelWithBidirectionalStream` (Nova Sonic speech-to-speech): GA March 2025, model in **Legacy lifecycle with EOL September 2026**. Server-side tool use (Responses API via bedrock-mantle): GA, currently supports GPT OSS 20B/120B, Claude Opus 4.7, Claude Haiku 4.5. Batch inference with Converse format: GA February 2026.

### Key concepts (Part 1)

- **Converse API** - `bedrock-runtime` operation providing a unified interface for all message-capable models. HTTP endpoint: `POST /model/{modelId}/converse`. Required IAM permission: `bedrock:InvokeModel`. Handles multi-turn conversations, tool use, guardrails, prompt caching, images, documents, video, and audio. Application logic does NOT change when switching models - only `modelId` changes.

- **ConverseStream API** - Streaming variant of Converse. HTTP endpoint: `POST /model/{modelId}/converse-stream`. IAM permission: `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream`. Returns a typed event stream: `messageStart`, `contentBlockStart`, `contentBlockDelta`, `contentBlockStop`, `messageStop`, `metadata`. **AWS CLI does NOT support this endpoint.** Check streaming support via `GetFoundationModel` (`responseStreamingSupported` field).

- **InvokeModel API** - Low-level single-inference API. Request body is model-specific (model-native JSON). Requires `bedrock:InvokeModel`. Use for: embeddings, image generation, models that don't support Converse, model-specific parameters not available in Converse. For streaming: `InvokeModelWithResponseStream`. For async jobs (e.g., video): `StartAsyncInvoke`. For real-time speech (Amazon Nova Sonic): `InvokeModelWithBidirectionalStream`.

- **modelId field** - Required field in URI (Converse) or header. Accepts: (1) base model ID e.g. `anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6`; (2) geo cross-region profile ID e.g. `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6`; (3) global inference profile ID e.g. `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6`; (4) application inference profile ARN; (5) provisioned throughput ARN; (6) Prompt Management prompt ARN; (7) marketplace endpoint ARN. Length: 1–2048 characters.

- **inferenceConfig** - Common inference parameters for all models in Converse API: `maxTokens` (integer, output token limit), `temperature` (0–1, randomness), `topP` (0–1, nucleus sampling), `stopSequences` (array of strings that stop generation). For model-specific parameters (e.g., `top_k`, `thinking`), use `additionalModelRequestFields`.

- **Cross-Region Inference Profile (Geo)** - System-defined profiles that route requests across multiple regions within the same geography to handle traffic bursts. Prefixes: `us.` (US), `eu.` (Europe), `au.` (Australia), `jp.` (Japan). Source region = the region you call; destination regions = other regions in the same geography. SCPs and IAM policies must allow `bedrock:InvokeModel` in ALL destination regions of the chosen profile. Per-model details (inference profile IDs and destination regions) are found on each individual model card.

- **Global Cross-Region Inference Profile** - Routes requests to any commercial region worldwide, optimizing throughput without data residency constraints. Prefix: `global.` (e.g., `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0`). Documented for Claude Sonnet 4.5; verify current supported models and source regions per individual model card. Offers ~10% cost savings vs geo profiles. Requires a three-statement IAM policy with condition `aws:RequestedRegion='unspecified'` for global routing. SCPs must allow `aws:RequestedRegion='unspecified'`. To disable, add a Deny on `RequestedRegion='unspecified'`. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/global-cross-region-inference.html_

- **Application Inference Profile** - User-created profile via `CreateInferenceProfile` to track costs and usage per team/environment/project. Can be based on: (1) a single foundation model to track a single region; (2) a cross-region system profile to track multi-region costs. Use the returned ARN as `modelId` in any inference operation.

- **Tool Use (Function Calling) - client-side** - The model does NOT directly call tools. Flow: (1) define tools in `toolConfig.tools[].toolSpec`; (2) model responds with `stopReason='tool_use'` and content with `toolUse` blocks; (3) application executes the tool; (4) send result back to model as `toolResult` content with status `'success'` or `'error'`; (5) model generates final response. `toolChoice` supports: `auto`, `any`, `tool`. With extended/adaptive thinking, `toolChoice` supports only `auto` or `none`.

- **Server-side tool use (Responses API)** - Available via the `bedrock-mantle` endpoint with the Responses API (OpenAI compatibility). Amazon Bedrock executes Lambda functions that implement tools (MCP JSON-RPC protocol) using the same IAM credentials as the calling application. Currently supported on GPT OSS 20B/120B; Claude support coming. Includes AWS built-in tools (`notes`, `tasks`) on `openai.gpt-oss-20b` and `openai.gpt-oss-120b`.

- **stopReason** - Field in Converse response indicating why the model stopped generating. Values: `end_turn` (normal completion), `tool_use` (tool execution required), `max_tokens` (token limit reached), `stop_sequence` (stop string found), `guardrail_intervened` (guardrail triggered), `content_filtered`, `malformed_model_output`, `malformed_tool_use`, `model_context_window_exceeded`.

- **Prompt Caching** - Optional feature that reduces latency and cost by caching static portions of the prompt (system, messages, tools). Implemented by inserting `cachePoint` blocks in content. Default TTL: 5 minutes; extended TTL of 1 hour supported **only** on: Claude Opus 4.5, Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.5 (Claude Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 support 5-minute TTL only; Claude Opus 4.7 is not in the supported-models table for prompt caching). Cache checkpoints processed in order: `tools` → `system` → `messages`. Cache read has reduced cost; cache write may cost more than uncached tokens. **Not supported with batch inference.** Simplified Cache Management: place a single `cachePoint` at the end of static content and the system automatically finds the best match up to ~20 content blocks back.

- **Extended Thinking / Adaptive Thinking** - Extended thinking: `thinking` parameter with `type='enabled'` and `budget_tokens` (minimum 1024 tokens) in `additionalModelRequestFields` (Converse) or native body (InvokeModel). Supported by Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude 4 (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku various). Claude 4 returns summarized thinking, not the full text. Streaming required if `max_tokens > 21333`. When `type='enabled'`: not compatible with `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, forced tool use. Adaptive thinking: `type='adaptive'` with `effort` (`max`/`high`/`medium`/`low`) in `output_config`. Recommended for Claude Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6; **mandatory for Claude Opus 4.7 and Claude Mythos Preview** (`thinking.type='enabled'` returns 400 on these models). Adaptive thinking automatically enables interleaved thinking with tool use.

- **Service Tiers** - `Standard` (default, `'default'` or omitted): consistent performance, pay-per-token. `Priority` (`'priority'`): +75% vs Standard, no reservation, better latency for customer-facing workloads. `Flex` (`'flex'`): -50% vs Standard, for non-interactive workloads (batch, summarization, agentic). `Reserved` (`'reserved'`): 99.5% uptime guaranteed, 1 or 3-month reservation, minimum 100K input TPM + 10K output TPM, requires contact with AWS account team. On-demand quota is shared among Standard, Priority, and Flex. Tier is visible in the response and in CloudTrail.

- **InvokeModelWithBidirectionalStream (Nova Sonic)** - API for real-time speech-to-speech voice conversations. Uses HTTP/2 for a persistent full-duplex channel (max 8 minutes per session). Currently supported only by Amazon Nova Sonic (`amazon.nova-sonic-v1:0`), a model in **Legacy lifecycle with EOL September 2026**. Input: Speech; Output: Speech + Text. Supports user interruptions mid-response. Does not support the Converse API (InvokeModel family only).

- **Models and Model Access** - Automatic access to all serverless models in all commercial regions with correct AWS Marketplace permissions. Exception: Anthropic requires a one-time FTU form (`PutUseCaseForModelAccess`) per account or per management account of an Org. Providers without an AWS Marketplace product key (Amazon, DeepSeek, Mistral, Meta, Qwen, OpenAI) cannot be blocked via subscription, but you can deny `bedrock:InvokeModel` on specific resources. Anthropic models on `bedrock-mantle` do NOT require the FTU form.

- **bedrock-mantle endpoint** - Distinct endpoint from `bedrock-runtime` for open-weight third-party models and APIs compatible with OpenAI/Anthropic. Supports: Chat Completions API, Messages API (native Anthropic for Claude Haiku 4.5, Opus 4.7, etc.), Responses API (server-side tool use with Lambda). URL: `bedrock-mantle.{region}.api.aws/v1` (OpenAI compat) or `bedrock-mantle.{region}.api.aws/anthropic/v1/messages` (Messages API). Anthropic models on `bedrock-mantle` do NOT require the Marketplace FTU form.

### Best practices (Part 1)

- **Always use Converse/ConverseStream instead of InvokeModel for conversational applications** - The interface is identical for all models: only `modelId` changes without rewriting logic. InvokeModel is required only for models that don't support messages (embeddings, image gen, Nova Sonic speech-to-speech) or to access model-specific parameters not available in Converse. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference.html_

- **Use geo inference profiles (e.g., `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6`) or global profiles (`global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6`) in production instead of direct model IDs** - Automatically distributes traffic across multiple regions to handle bursts and reduce `ThrottlingException`. The global profile also offers ~10% cost savings vs geo. Update SCPs with condition `aws:RequestedRegion='unspecified'` to enable global routing. Updated model IDs and inference profile IDs are found on each individual model card. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-profiles-support.html_

- **Create application inference profiles with tags for each environment/team for cost tracking** - The `tags` field in `CreateInferenceProfile` enables use of AWS Cost Allocation Tags to attribute inference costs to specific cost centers without modifying application code. Use the control plane client `bedrock` (not `bedrock-runtime`) for creation. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-profiles-create.html_

- **Handle the tool_use cycle with a loop WHILE `stopReason == 'tool_use'`; exit on `end_turn` or any other terminal stop reason** - The model may request multiple consecutive tool uses in a single conversation. Continue sending `toolResult` blocks and re-invoking Converse as long as `stopReason == 'tool_use'`. Exit the loop when `stopReason` is `end_turn`, `max_tokens`, `stop_sequence`, `guardrail_intervened`, or any other non-tool stop reason. Always pass `status` (`'success'` or `'error'`) in the `toolResult`. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/tool-use-client-side.html_

- **Add `cachePoint` at the end of the system prompt and static documents to enable prompt caching** - Reduces latency and cost for workloads with long static contexts (RAG docs, long system prompts). Cache hits are not counted against the TPM quota. Use Simplified Cache Management for simplicity: place a single `cachePoint` after static content. Cache checkpoints are processed in `tools` → `system` → `messages` order: altering an upstream section invalidates downstream checkpoints. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-caching.html_

- **Use adaptive thinking (`thinking.type='adaptive'`) for Claude Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, and Opus 4.7 instead of extended thinking with a fixed `budget_tokens`** - Adaptive thinking lets the model autonomously decide when and how much to think based on request complexity, yielding better performance than a fixed budget. It is the **only mode supported on Claude Opus 4.7** (`budget_tokens` returns 400). On Claude Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6, `thinking.type='enabled'` is deprecated. Pass `thinking` and `effort` (optional) in `additionalModelRequestFields` when using the Converse API. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/claude-messages-adaptive-thinking.html_

- **Use `requestMetadata` to tag each call with business attributes (team, env, experiment)** - Key-value pairs in `requestMetadata` (max 16 pairs, key and value max 256 chars) are written to model invocation logs and can be filtered for usage analysis and debugging, with no billing impact. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.html_

- **Implement retry with exponential backoff for `ThrottlingException` (HTTP 429)** - `bedrock-runtime` no longer exposes RPM (requests-per-minute) quotas; throttling is governed by TPM (tokens per minute, input+output combined). `ThrottlingException` indicates account quota exceeded. Implement custom backoff or request a quota increase via the Service Quotas console. Before requesting an increase, verify the model is not in Legacy or Deprecated state. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/quotas-runtime.html_

- **Verify model access prerequisites BEFORE invoking in production, not during** - The first invocation of a third-party model initiates the Marketplace subscription in the background (up to 15 min). If prerequisites are missing, the subscription fails and subsequent calls return `AccessDeniedException` for up to 2 minutes. Pre-verify during setup/bootstrap. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html_

- **Do not include `additionalModelRequestFields`, `inferenceConfig`, `system`, or `toolConfig` when using a Prompt Management prompt** - The Converse API ignores/rejects these fields when `modelId` points to a Prompt Management prompt version ARN. These parameters must be defined directly in the prompt resource. If `messages` are included, they are appended after those defined in the prompt. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference.html_

- **To completely block access to a model, deny BOTH `bedrock:InvokeModel` AND `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream`** - Denying only one of the two does not block access via Converse. Both actions must be denied because Converse uses `bedrock:InvokeModel` and ConverseStream uses `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream`. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.html_

- **Use the Flex service tier for asynchronous and non-interactive workloads (batch processing, summarization, long agentic workflows)** - The Flex tier offers 50% savings vs Standard tier for workloads that can tolerate higher latencies. Ideal for background processing, offline RAG pipelines, model evaluations. Set `service_tier='flex'` in the Converse request. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/service-tiers-inference.html_

### Configuration reference (Part 1)

| Name | Description | Default / example |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `bedrock:InvokeModel` | IAM action required for Converse and InvokeModel. To deny access to a specific model, use it with the model's resource ARN. | `arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream` | IAM action required for ConverseStream and InvokeModelWithResponseStream. MUST be denied alongside `bedrock:InvokeModel` to fully block access. | Add to Deny together with `bedrock:InvokeModel` |
| `aws-marketplace:Subscribe` | IAM action required for auto-enabling third-party serverless models on first use. Not needed for subsequent invocations. Does not apply to Amazon, DeepSeek, Mistral, Meta, Qwen, OpenAI. | `Condition: {"ForAnyValue:StringEquals": {"aws-marketplace:ProductId": ["prod-..."]}}` |
| `inferenceConfig.maxTokens` | Maximum number of tokens to generate in the response. Depends on the model's context window. If reached, `stopReason = 'max_tokens'`. Claude Sonnet 4.6 and Opus 4.6: max 64K. Claude Opus 4.7: max 128K. | `512` (default varies by model) |
| `inferenceConfig.temperature` | Controls output randomness. Value between 0 and 1. 0 = deterministic, 1 = maximum variability. Not compatible with extended thinking when `thinking.type='enabled'`; the `'adaptive'` thinking type does not document this restriction. | `0.7` |
| `inferenceConfig.topP` | Nucleus sampling: considers only tokens whose cumulative probability is <= topP. Alternative to temperature; usually not used together. Not compatible with extended/adaptive thinking. | `0.9` |
| `inferenceConfig.stopSequences` | Array of strings that stop generation. Stop text is not included in the output. | `["\n\nHuman:", "</response>"]` |
| `additionalModelRequestFields` | Model-specific parameters not supported by `inferenceConfig`. For Claude: `top_k` (integer); `thinking` object (`type='enabled'`+`budget_tokens` for older models, `type='adaptive'` for Opus 4.6/Sonnet 4.6/Opus 4.7); `output_config.effort` for adaptive thinking. Format: JSON object. | `{"thinking": {"type": "adaptive"}, "output_config": {"effort": "high"}}` |
| `bedrock-runtime endpoint` | Regional endpoint for Converse, ConverseStream, InvokeModel. Format: `bedrock-runtime.{region}.amazonaws.com`. FIPS available for us-east-1, us-east-2, us-west-2, ca-central-1, us-gov-east-1, us-gov-west-1. | `bedrock-runtime.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` |
| `bedrock endpoint (control plane)` | Endpoint for management APIs: `CreateInferenceProfile`, `ListFoundationModels`, `GetFoundationModel`, `PutUseCaseForModelAccess`, etc. NOT for inference. | `bedrock.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` |
| `bedrock-mantle endpoint` | Endpoint for native Anthropic Messages API and Responses API (OpenAI compat). Used by Claude Haiku 4.5, Opus 4.7 on bedrock-mantle for Messages API. URL: `bedrock-mantle.{region}.api.aws/anthropic/v1/messages` (Messages) or `/v1` (OpenAI compat). | `bedrock-mantle.us-east-1.api.aws/anthropic/v1/messages` |
| `Cross-region profile ID prefix (Geo)` | Prefix of the geo-specific profile ID: `us.` (US), `eu.` (Europe), `au.` (Australia), `jp.` (Japan). Destination regions are fixed and do not change over time. | `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| `Cross-region profile ID prefix (Global)` | `global.` prefix for routing across all commercial regions worldwide. Destination regions expand as new commercial regions are added. Requires a three-statement IAM policy. | `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| `requestMetadata` | Map string-string (max 16 pairs, key max 256 chars, value max 256 chars) for tagging calls in logs. Key pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9\s:_@$#=/+,-.]+` | `{"team": "ai-platform", "env": "prod"}` |
| `cachePoint.ttl` | Cache TTL. Values: `'5m'` (default, all supported models) or `'1h'` (only Claude Opus 4.5, Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.5; Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 support 5-minute TTL only). Note: 1h entries must precede 5m entries in the same request. | `"5m"` (implicit default if omitted) |
| `service_tier` | Optional Converse/InvokeModel parameter to choose the tier. Values: `'default'` (Standard), `'priority'` (+75% vs Standard, no reservation, better latency), `'flex'` (-50% vs Standard, for non-interactive workloads), `'reserved'` (reserved capacity, only if configured). On-demand quota shared among priority/default/flex. | `"default"` (implicit if omitted) |
| `TPM Quota (bedrock-runtime)` | Token-per-minute quotas on bedrock-runtime count input+output combined per individual model. RPM (requests-per-minute) is no longer enforced. Separate quotas for On-demand vs Cross-Region InvokeModel. Max tokens per day = TPM * 24 * 60 by default. | Verify in Service Quotas console: Amazon Bedrock > On-demand InvokeModel tokens per minute for {model} |
| `additionalModelRequestFields.thinking.budget_tokens` | Maximum tokens Claude can use for internal reasoning (extended thinking). Minimum: 1024. Must be < `max_tokens`. The model may use fewer. Above 32K, batch processing is recommended to avoid timeouts. Deprecated on Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6; NOT supported on Opus 4.7 (use `type='adaptive'`). | `{"thinking": {"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 5000}}` |

### Gotchas (Part 1)

- **AWS CLI does NOT support ConverseStream** (or `InvokeModelWithResponseStream`). Always use an SDK (Python boto3, Node.js, Java, etc.) for streaming.

- **Denying only `bedrock:InvokeModel` does NOT block access via Converse**: you must deny BOTH `bedrock:InvokeModel` AND `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream`.

- **The first invocation of an Anthropic model without the FTU form fails with `AccessDeniedException`**. The form must be submitted BEFORE production deploy via the console or `PutUseCaseForModelAccess` API.

- **Cross-region inference profiles (geo): if a destination region is blocked by SCPs, ALL requests to the profile fail even if other destination regions are available.** Update SCPs to allow `bedrock:InvokeModel` in ALL destination regions of the chosen profile.

- **Global cross-region inference profile: SCPs using `StringEquals` conditions on `aws:RequestedRegion` do not capture global routing.** To enable global routing, SCPs must also allow `aws:RequestedRegion='unspecified'`. To disable it, add a Deny with `StringEquals` on `'unspecified'`.

- **When using a Prompt Management prompt as `modelId`, do NOT include `inferenceConfig`, `system`, `toolConfig`, or `additionalModelRequestFields`** - these are ignored or cause a 400 error. `messages` are appended after those defined in the prompt.

- **Claude Opus 4.7 (and Claude Mythos Preview) supports ONLY `thinking.type='adaptive'`**. Using `thinking.type='enabled'` with `budget_tokens` on these models returns HTTP 400. Migrate code from `budget_tokens` to `type='adaptive'` before updating the `modelId`.

- **`thinking.type='enabled'` with `budget_tokens` is DEPRECATED on Claude Opus 4.6 and Claude Sonnet 4.6**. Use `type='adaptive'`. Older models (Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5, Claude 3.7 Sonnet) do NOT support adaptive thinking and still require `type='enabled'` with `budget_tokens`.

- **The `effort` parameter for adaptive thinking MUST be placed inside `output_config`, NOT inside the `thinking` object.** Placing `effort` inside `thinking` causes `ValidationException`.

- **Extended thinking (`thinking.type='enabled'`) is not compatible with `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`**. If using `type='enabled'`, remove these parameters from `inferenceConfig` and `additionalModelRequestFields`. This incompatibility is documented for `type='enabled'`; `type='adaptive'` does not carry this documented restriction.

- **Prompt caching: cache checkpoints are processed in `tools` → `system` → `messages` order**. If you alter content before a checkpoint (in an 'upstream' section), all subsequent checkpoints are also invalidated. Keep content before `cachePoint` blocks identical across requests.

- **Prompt caching does NOT work with batch inference** (`StartAsyncInvoke`). Only with on-demand (Converse, InvokeModel).

- **Cache entries with TTL `1h` must precede entries with TTL `5m` in the same request**. Mixing TTLs in the reverse order causes an error.

- **With Mistral AI and Meta models, the Converse API automatically wraps input in a model-specific prompt template**. This can affect token counts compared to using InvokeModel directly.

- **Automatic Marketplace subscription on first use takes up to 15 minutes**. During this time, API calls may temporarily succeed or return `AccessDeniedException` intermittently.

- **The `name` field in `DocumentBlock` (`document.name`) is vulnerable to prompt injection**: the model may interpret it as an instruction. Always use neutral, descriptive names - never unsanitized user input.

- **`toolConfig` CANNOT be used together with a Prompt Management prompt** (returns `ValidationException`). Tool choice with extended/adaptive thinking supports only `'auto'` or `'none'`.

- **The `bedrock-mantle` endpoint is distinct from `bedrock-runtime`** and serves both open-weight third-party models (DeepSeek, Gemma, MiniMax, etc.) with OpenAI API compat, and Anthropic models with native Messages API. Anthropic models on `bedrock-mantle` do NOT require the Marketplace FTU form.

- **`bedrock-runtime` no longer exposes RPM (requests-per-minute) quotas**: throttling is governed entirely by TPM (tokens per minute, input+output combined). `ThrottlingException` indicates TPM quota exceeded, not RPM.

- **Model IDs for newer models (Claude Sonnet 4.6: `anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6`; Opus 4.6: `anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1`; Opus 4.7: `anthropic.claude-opus-4-7`) no longer follow the pattern with a date string (e.g., `-20240229-`), but use short names without an explicit version string.** Always verify on the individual model card.

- **Amazon Nova Sonic (`InvokeModelWithBidirectionalStream`) is in Legacy lifecycle with EOL September 2026**. Evaluate migration to Nova Sonic 2 or successors before deprecation.

## Part 2 - Knowledge Bases & RAG

### Overview (Part 2)

Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases is a fully managed capability that implements the entire RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflow: document ingestion, chunking, embedding generation, vector store storage, and runtime retrieval. It exposes two main runtime APIs: **Retrieve** (returns raw chunks with relevance scores) and **RetrieveAndGenerate** (full pipeline with natural language response generation and source citations). It supports structured and unstructured data sources, multimodal content, metadata filtering, reranking, and integrates natively with Amazon Bedrock Agents via `AssociateAgentKnowledgeBase`.

Official documented quotas: max 100 KB per account, 5 concurrent ingestion jobs per account (1 per KB, 1 per data source), Retrieve/RetrieveAndGenerate at 20 rps, StartIngestionJob at 0.1 rps.

**Maturity:** GA for core features: vector KB with S3, OpenSearch Serverless, OpenSearch Managed Cluster, Aurora pgvector, MongoDB Atlas, Pinecone, Redis Enterprise Cloud, Neptune Analytics, Amazon S3 Vectors. **Preview:** Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) parser (us-west-2 only, subject to change). GA: Foundation model parser (Claude vision, Nova vision, LLama 4 vision). Reranking GA: Amazon Rerank 1.0 (ap-northeast-1, ca-central-1, eu-central-1, us-west-2), Cohere Rerank 3.5 (ap-northeast-1, ca-central-1, eu-central-1, us-east-1, us-west-2). Hybrid search GA: supported on Amazon RDS (Aurora), Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, and MongoDB Atlas. S3 Vectors: GA, available in regions where both Bedrock and S3 Vectors are available.

---

### Key concepts (Part 2)

- **Knowledge Base (KB)** - Bedrock resource that bridges data sources and RAG applications. Contains configuration for the embedding model, vector store, and data sources. Managed via `bedrock-agent` (control plane) and queried via `bedrock-agent-runtime` (runtime plane). Limit: max 100 KB per account per region.

- **Data Source** - Connector to a data source attached to a KB. GA supported sources: Amazon S3 (most common), custom API via `IngestKnowledgeBaseDocuments`. Preview: Confluence, Microsoft SharePoint, Salesforce. Structured data: Amazon Redshift (SQL KB). Configuration includes `vectorIngestionConfiguration` (parsing + chunking + Lambda transform). Limit: max 5 data sources per KB.

- **Chunking Strategy** - How documents are divided before embedding. 4 strategies: `NONE` (whole file = 1 chunk), `FIXED_SIZE` (maxTokens + overlapPercentage, default ~300 tokens with sentence boundary preservation), `HIERARCHICAL` (parent chunk + child chunk, retrieval returns the parent), `SEMANTIC` (uses an FM to understand semantic boundaries, extra cost, includes `bufferSize` and `maxTokens` plus `breakpointPercentileThreshold`). **Chunking strategy CANNOT be changed after data source creation.**

- **Vector Store** - Vector database where embeddings are stored. GA options: Amazon OpenSearch Serverless (auto-create available via console), OpenSearch Managed Cluster (Public access only, NOT VPC), Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL with pgvector, Amazon S3 Vectors (float32 only, optimized for infrequent queries), Neptune Analytics (GraphRAG), Pinecone, Redis Enterprise Cloud, MongoDB Atlas. Only OpenSearch Serverless and OpenSearch Managed support binary vectors.

- **Embedding Model** - Model that converts text into numerical vectors. Supported: `amazon.titan-embed-text-v1` (1536 dim, float32, only 4 regions), `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0` (256/512/1024 dim, float32 or binary, 21 regions including GovCloud), `cohere.embed-english-v3` (1024 dim, float32 or binary, 12 regions), `cohere.embed-multilingual-v3` (1024 dim, float32 or binary, 12 regions). Multimodal: `amazon.titan-multimodal-embeddings-v1` (1024 dim, float32) and Cohere embed v3 multimodal (1024 dim, float32 or binary).

- **Ingestion Job** - Asynchronous process that reads documents from the data source, parses them, chunks them, generates embeddings, and writes them to the vector store. Initiated with `StartIngestionJob` (bedrock-agent API). Sync is incremental: only documents added/modified/deleted since the last sync are reprocessed. Monitor with `GetIngestionJob` until status `COMPLETE`. Quotas: max 5 concurrent jobs per account, 1 per KB, 1 per data source, max 5M files to add/update and 5M files to delete per job, max 100 GB per job, max 50 MB per single file (text).

- **Retrieve API** - `POST /knowledgebases/{knowledgeBaseId}/retrieve` - queries the KB and returns the most relevant chunks as an array of `KnowledgeBaseRetrievalResult`, each with `content`, `location`, `metadata`, and similarity score. Supports pagination with `nextToken`, metadata filter, configurable number of results, reranking, and `overrideSearchType` (SEMANTIC/HYBRID). Quota: 20 rps.

- **RetrieveAndGenerate API** - `POST /retrieveAndGenerate` - full RAG pipeline: internally executes Retrieve + InvokeModel. Input: query text + KB configuration + `modelArn`. Output: text response with `citations` (mapping between response spans and source chunks). Maintains conversational context via `sessionId`. Supports guardrails, custom prompt template, inference profile for cross-region inference. Streaming version also available: `RetrieveAndGenerateStream`. Quota: 20 rps.

- **Metadata Filtering** - Allows filtering retrieval results based on metadata associated with documents. For S3, create `.metadata.json` files (`filename.ext.metadata.json`) in the same location as the document. Supported operators: `equals`, `notEquals`, `greaterThan`, `greaterThanOrEquals`, `lessThan`, `lessThanOrEquals`, `in`, `notIn`, `stringContains` (not in console), `listContains` (not in console), `startsWith`. Operators are combined with `andAll`/`orAll`. Note: `'in'` and `'notIn'` are optimized for OpenSearch Serverless and Neptune Analytics; `'stringContains'` optimized for OpenSearch Serverless; **S3 Vectors does NOT support `'startsWith'` and `'stringContains'`**.

- **AssociateAgentKnowledgeBase** - API to link a Knowledge Base to a Bedrock Agent. Requires `agentId`, `agentVersion` (always `'DRAFT'`), `knowledgeBaseId`, and a `description` (text that tells the agent when and how to use the KB). The `description` field is critical: it is the text the agent's orchestration system uses to decide whether to query the KB. After association, call `PrepareAgent` to make the change effective. Quota: max 2 KBs associated per agent (increasable), 6 rps.

- **Service Role (IAM)** - IAM role assumed by `bedrock.amazonaws.com` to operate on the KB. Must have: trust policy toward `bedrock.amazonaws.com` with `aws:SourceAccount` condition, policy for `bedrock:InvokeModel` on the embedding model ARN, policy for `s3:GetObject`/`s3:ListBucket` on the data source, policy for the vector store (e.g., `aoss:APIAccessAll` for OpenSearch Serverless, `rds-data:BatchExecuteStatement`/`ExecuteStatement` for Aurora, `s3vectors:*` for S3 Vectors).

- **Inference Profile (in KB context)** - Alternative resource ARN to a direct model ARN that enables cross-region inference and cost tracking. Can be used in `modelArn` of `RetrieveAndGenerate` or in `CreateDataSource` (for FM parser) to distribute requests across multiple regions and increase throughput. Data may be shared across regions: use with caution for sensitive data.

- **Reranking** - Optional post-processing of retrieved chunks that reorders results using a dedicated reranking model. GA models: `amazon.rerank-v1:0` (**NOT available in us-east-1**, available in ap-northeast-1, ca-central-1, eu-central-1, us-west-2) and `cohere.rerank-v3-5:0` (available in ap-northeast-1, ca-central-1, eu-central-1, us-east-1, us-west-2). Rerank API quota: 10 rps.

- **Hybrid Search** - Search mode that combines vector similarity (semantic) with full-text search (BM25). Supported ONLY for vector stores: Amazon RDS (Aurora pgvector), Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, and MongoDB Atlas (all require a filterable text field in the vector index). For other vector stores, search uses only SEMANTIC. Activate with `overrideSearchType: 'HYBRID'`.

---

### Best practices (Part 2)

- **Let the console automatically create the OpenSearch Serverless vector store for the first Knowledge Base** - Bedrock automatically configures the collection, index, field mapping, and data access policy with the correct parameters (faiss engine, not nmslib). Recreating it manually requires precise configuration of the faiss engine, dimension matching, and AOSS policies - a common source of errors. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-create.html_

- **Choose the chunking strategy before creating the data source: it is not modifiable afterward** - Chunking configuration cannot be changed once the data source is created. To change strategy, a new data source must be created. Plan chunking in advance based on document type (long/short, technical/narrative). _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-data-source-customize-ingestion.html_

- **Use HIERARCHICAL chunking for long, technical documents where broad context is needed but precise search is required** - Child chunks are more precise for retrieval, but are replaced by the broader parent chunk before being passed to the LLM, providing context without degrading precision. Ideal for technical documentation, contracts, manuals. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-chunking.html_

- **Use SEMANTIC chunking only if retrieval quality is critical and the extra cost is acceptable** - Semantic chunking internally uses a Foundation Model to determine semantic boundaries, incurring additional costs proportional to data volume. It offers the best quality for narrative texts but is not necessary for structured documents. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-chunking.html_

- **Scope IAM permissions to the specific knowledge base ARN, do not use wildcards (`*`) in production** - Example policies use `*` for `knowledgeBaseId` because the ARN is not known before creation. After creation, update the trust policy and resource policies with the specific ARN following the principle of least privilege. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-permissions.html_

- **Do not share the service role among multiple knowledge bases** - Official documentation explicitly states that a policy cannot be shared among multiple roles when using the service role. Each KB must have its own dedicated role. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-permissions.html_

- **Use the Retrieve API + a separate InvokeModel call instead of RetrieveAndGenerate when you want control over the prompt** - `RetrieveAndGenerate` is convenient but offers limited customization. With `Retrieve`, you get the relevant chunks and build the prompt manually, allowing injection of system instructions, chain-of-thought, or specific business logic. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-how-retrieval.html_

- **Provide a detailed, specific description when associating a KB to a Bedrock Agent** - The `description` field in `AssociateAgentKnowledgeBase` (max 200 characters) is the text the agent's orchestration system uses to autonomously decide when to query the KB. A vague description leads to under-use or over-use of the KB. Example: `'Contains product catalog with pricing, specs, and availability. Query when user asks about products, prices, or stock.'` _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent_AssociateAgentKnowledgeBase.html_

- **For Aurora pgvector, enable HNSW iterative scans (pgvector >= 0.8.0) when using metadata filtering** - Without iterative scan, selective metadata filters may return fewer results than expected because filtering occurs after the HNSW scan. With `ALTER DATABASE ... SET hnsw.iterative_scan = 'relaxed_order'`, the index continues scanning until enough filtered results are found. Settings only take effect on new sessions; if using RDS Data API, wait a few minutes for connection pool recycling. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-setup.html_

- **Use `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0` as the default embedding model for new projects** - Titan V2 supports configurable dimensions (256/512/1024), both float32 and binary embeddings, and is available in 21 regions (including GovCloud) vs Titan V1 (only 4 regions: ap-northeast-1, eu-central-1, us-east-1, us-west-2). _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-supported.html_

- **Wait a few minutes after ingestion job completion before querying the KB (except Aurora)** - Documentation specifies that after ingestion job completion, you may need to wait a few minutes for vector embeddings to become available in the vector store for queries, for all vector stores except Amazon Aurora RDS. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-data-source-sync-ingest.html_

- **For OpenSearch Managed Cluster, use Public access (not VPC) and configure Fine-grained access control** - Domains behind VPC are NOT supported for Knowledge Bases. Use Public access with fine-grained access control to protect data. Require Engine version >= 2.13 for knn index, >= 2.16 for binary embeddings. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-setup.html_

- **Do not change the parsing strategy type after creation: create a new data source** - The parsing strategy type (`BEDROCK_FOUNDATION_MODEL` vs `BEDROCK_DATA_AUTOMATION` vs default) is not modifiable after data source creation. Only internal parameters of the same strategy can be updated (e.g., `modelArn` inside `bedrockFoundationModelConfiguration`). To change type, a new data source is needed. When updating, first retrieve the complete configuration with `GetDataSource` and pass the entire `vectorIngestionConfiguration` modifying only the specific field. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-data-source-customize-ingestion.html_

- **Do not add S3 location for multimodal storage after KB creation: plan it from the start** - It is not possible to add an S3 URI for multimodal data storage (images, figures, tables) after the knowledge base is created. If you want multimodal support, it must be configured during KB creation. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-data-source-customize-ingestion.html_

- **Use Cohere Rerank 3.5 (not Amazon Rerank 1.0) if operating in us-east-1** - Amazon Rerank 1.0 (`amazon.rerank-v1:0`) is NOT supported in us-east-1. In that region only Cohere Rerank 3.5 (`cohere.rerank-v3-5:0`) is available. Always verify regional availability of the reranker before use. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/rerank-supported.html_

- **Use S3 Vectors as a vector store only for workloads with infrequent queries, not for high concurrency** - S3 Vectors offers sub-second latency for infrequent queries and latency up to 100ms for more frequent queries, but is not optimized for high concurrency. It is the most economical vector store for RAG with sporadic queries. Does not support binary embeddings or hybrid search. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-setup.html_

- **Handle the StartIngestionJob rate limit (0.1 rps) with exponential backoff retry** - `StartIngestionJob` has a limit of 0.1 requests per second (1 every 10 seconds) per account per region and is not increasable. In automated pipelines with many KBs, serialize calls with >= 10 second delays or implement retry with exponential backoff and jitter. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/bedrock.html_

### Configuration reference (Part 2)

| Name | Description | Default / example |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `embeddingModelArn` | ARN of the Foundation Model used to generate embeddings during ingestion. Format: `arn:aws:bedrock:{region}::foundation-model/{model-id}` | `arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0` |
| `embeddingModelConfiguration.dimensions` | Number of embedding vector dimensions. Must match the vector store configuration. For titan-embed-text-v2:0: 256, 512, or 1024. For titan-embed-text-v1: fixed 1536. For cohere.embed-*-v3: fixed 1024. | `1024` |
| `embeddingModelConfiguration.embeddingDataType` | Vector type: `FLOAT32` (default, higher precision) or `BINARY` (reduces storage ~32x, lower precision). Binary supported only by Titan V2 and Cohere v3, and requires OpenSearch Serverless or Managed Cluster. S3 Vectors does NOT support binary embeddings. | `FLOAT32` |
| `chunkingStrategy` | Chunking strategy: `NONE` (whole file), `FIXED_SIZE` (fixed tokens), `HIERARCHICAL` (parent+child), `SEMANTIC` (context-aware via FM). Not modifiable after data source creation. | Default (if omitted): ~300 tokens with sentence boundary preservation |
| `fixedSizeChunkingConfiguration.maxTokens` | Maximum number of tokens per chunk in FIXED_SIZE strategy. | `300` |
| `fixedSizeChunkingConfiguration.overlapPercentage` | Percentage of overlap between consecutive chunks in FIXED_SIZE strategy. Helps maintain context between chunks. | `20` (20%) |
| `hierarchicalChunkingConfiguration.levelConfigurations[0].maxTokens` | Maximum size of the parent chunk in HIERARCHICAL chunking. The parent is returned to the LLM during retrieval. | `1500` |
| `hierarchicalChunkingConfiguration.levelConfigurations[1].maxTokens` | Maximum size of the child chunk in HIERARCHICAL chunking. Child chunks are used for vector search. | `300` |
| `semanticChunkingConfiguration.breakpointPercentileThreshold` | Percentile of distance/dissimilarity between sentences to determine breakpoints in SEMANTIC chunking. Higher values = larger chunks, fewer chunks. | `95` |
| `semanticChunkingConfiguration.bufferSize` | Number of adjacent context sentences to consider for semantic breakpoint calculation. Increase to improve coherence at the cost of more processing. | `0` |
| `semanticChunkingConfiguration.maxTokens` | Maximum size in tokens of a single semantic chunk. | `300` |
| `vectorSearchConfiguration.numberOfResults` | Number of chunks to retrieve from the vector store per query. Configurable in Retrieve and RetrieveAndGenerate. With HIERARCHICAL chunking, actual result count may be lower because child chunks with the same parent are deduplicated. | `5` |
| `vectorSearchConfiguration.overrideSearchType` | Search type: `SEMANTIC` (vector similarity only) or `HYBRID` (vector + full-text BM25). HYBRID available only for Amazon RDS (Aurora), OpenSearch Serverless, and MongoDB Atlas with filterable text field. If omitted, Bedrock chooses automatically. | `SEMANTIC` (default) |
| `knowledgeBaseId` | Unique identifier of the Knowledge Base. Pattern: `[0-9a-zA-Z]{10}`. Used as path parameter in Retrieve and as body parameter in RetrieveAndGenerate. | `KB12345678` |
| `sessionId` | Session identifier for RetrieveAndGenerate. Cannot be set manually: auto-generated on the first call. Reuse in subsequent calls to maintain conversational context. | Auto-generated, pattern: `[0-9a-zA-Z._:-]+` |
| `agentVersion` (in AssociateAgentKnowledgeBase) | Version of the agent to associate the KB to. Must always be `'DRAFT'` (fixed 5-character string). Only the DRAFT version can be modified. | `DRAFT` |

### Gotchas (Part 2)

- **Chunking strategy CANNOT be changed after data source creation.** To change it you must delete and recreate the data source (all documents indexed for that source are lost).

- **It is not possible to add the S3 field for multimodal storage (images, figures, tables) after the Knowledge Base is created.** If you want multimodal support, the S3 URI must be configured during KB creation.

- **The parsing strategy type (e.g., `BEDROCK_FOUNDATION_MODEL` vs `BEDROCK_DATA_AUTOMATION`) is not modifiable after data source creation.** Only internal parameters of the same strategy can be updated. To change type, a new data source is needed.

- **It is not possible to create a Knowledge Base with the AWS root user.** An IAM user with appropriate permissions must be used.

- **OpenSearch Managed Cluster requires Public access (NOT VPC).** OpenSearch domains behind VPC are not supported for Knowledge Bases.

- **For OpenSearch, use engine `'faiss'` (not `'nmslib'`): the nmslib engine causes silent failure of metadata filtering.**

- **The Aurora cluster must reside in the same AWS account as the Knowledge Base.** Cross-account Aurora is not supported.

- **After completing an ingestion job, wait a few minutes before querying the KB if using OpenSearch Serverless, OpenSearch Managed, Pinecone, or Redis.** Only Aurora RDS is immediately available after completion.

- **`AssociateAgentKnowledgeBase` requires `agentVersion='DRAFT'` (exact string).** After association, `PrepareAgent` must be called to make the change effective. Without `PrepareAgent`, the KB is not used by the agent.

- **The `description` field in `AssociateAgentKnowledgeBase` (max 200 characters) is critical for agent behavior**: it is the text the orchestration system uses to decide when to query the KB. A vague description will degrade agent behavior.

- **Do not share the IAM service role among multiple Knowledge Bases**: official documentation explicitly states that a policy cannot be shared among multiple service role roles.

- **Semantic chunking incurs additional costs for internal use of a Foundation Model during ingestion.** Do not use it for large datasets if the budget is constrained.

- **HIERARCHICAL chunking is not recommended with Amazon S3 Vectors as vector store**: with high parent chunk token counts, parent-child metadata can exceed the 1 KB metadata limit per vector imposed by S3 Vectors.

- **S3 Vectors does NOT support binary embeddings (float32 only).** Use OpenSearch Serverless or Managed Cluster for binary vectors.

- **S3 Vectors does NOT support filter operators `'startsWith'` and `'stringContains'`.** If these operators are required in metadata filtering, choose a different vector store.

- **Hybrid search (`overrideSearchType: HYBRID`) is supported ONLY for Amazon RDS (Aurora), OpenSearch Serverless, and MongoDB Atlas.** For other vector stores (Pinecone, Redis, Neptune, S3 Vectors), the search silently fails or uses only SEMANTIC.

- **Amazon Rerank 1.0 (`amazon.rerank-v1:0`) is NOT available in us-east-1.** In that region use Cohere Rerank 3.5 (`cohere.rerank-v3-5:0`).

- **For Aurora pgvector with metadata filtering, enable HNSW iterative scan (pgvector >= 0.8.0) or selective filters will return fewer results than expected.** `ALTER DATABASE` settings only take effect on new sessions; with RDS Data API, wait a few minutes for connection pool recycling.

- **Custom metadata fields in OpenSearch Managed must use `'keyword'` type (or text + keyword subfield) in the mapping.** Without this configuration, filtering queries fail with error `'Rewrite first'`.

- **The `sessionId` in `RetrieveAndGenerate` is auto-generated on the first call and cannot be set manually.** Save the value from the response and reuse it for subsequent calls in the same conversation.

- **Binary embeddings are supported only by OpenSearch Serverless and OpenSearch Managed Cluster as vector store.** With Aurora, Pinecone, Redis, S3 Vectors, etc., KB creation will fail.

- **Confluence, SharePoint, Salesforce data source connectors are in Preview and subject to changes.**

- **Cross-region inference via inference profile shares data across AWS regions.** Verify data residency requirements before using inference profiles with sensitive data.

- **`StartIngestionJob` has a rate limit of 0.1 rps (1 every 10 seconds) per account per region and is NOT increasable.** Serialize calls in automated pipelines.

- **The `'associated KBs per Agent'` quota is only 2 by default (but increasable).** Plan the multi-KB architecture for agents that must query many sources.

- **The Foundation Model parser has a limit of 100 GB total file size. The BDA parser has a limit of 1000 files.** Verify limits before using these parsers on large datasets.

- **`bedrock-agent` (control plane) and `bedrock-agent-runtime` (runtime) are available in a subset of regions compared to standard Bedrock endpoints.** Verify regional availability before deploying.
