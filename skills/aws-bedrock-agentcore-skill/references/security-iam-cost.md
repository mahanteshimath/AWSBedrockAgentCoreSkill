## Overview

Complete operational guide for configuring least-privilege IAM, KMS encryption, VPC/PrivateLink, data privacy, and cost optimization for AI agents on Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime. Covers the real execution roles for both Bedrock Agents and AgentCore Runtime, `bedrock:InvokeModel` / `bedrock-agentcore:*` permissions, token-based quotas (TPM/TPD with 5x burndown rate for Claude 3.7+), cost-saving strategies via prompt caching, intelligent prompt routing, cross-region inference, batch inference, and Provisioned Throughput. Includes the three specific AgentCore PrivateLink endpoints and AgentCore Runtime quotas (active sessions, TPS, hardware allocation).

**Maturity note:** All features covered are **GA** as of June 2026, with the following exceptions: Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 prompt caching is listed as "Preview" in the official `prompt-caching.html` table. **AgentCore Harness, Payments, Optimization, and Registry maturity changed after the June baseline** - re-check `freshness-2026-08.md`, release notes, and Region tables before production use. Claude Mythos is in Gated Research Preview in us-east-1 only.

## Key concepts

### Execution Role (AgentCore Runtime)

IAM role assumed by the service principal `bedrock-agentcore.amazonaws.com` to run an agent. Requires permissions on ECR (image pull), CloudWatch Logs, X-Ray, CloudWatch metrics (namespace `bedrock-agentcore`), `bedrock:InvokeModel` / `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream`, and `bedrock-agentcore:GetWorkloadAccessToken*`. The trust policy **must** use `aws:SourceAccount` + `aws:SourceArn` to prevent confused deputy attacks.

### Execution Role (Bedrock Agents classic)

IAM service role assumed by `bedrock.amazonaws.com` to orchestrate traditional agents. Minimum permissions: `bedrock:InvokeModel` on specific foundation model ARNs, `s3:GetObject` for OpenAPI schemas, `bedrock:Retrieve` for knowledge bases. Optional: `bedrock:InvokeAgent` (multi-agent), `bedrock:ApplyGuardrail`, `bedrock:GetProvisionedModelThroughput`.

### BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess managed policy

AWS managed policy for dev/quick-start covering `bedrock-agentcore:*`, `iam` (PassRole scoped to `*BedrockAgentCore*`), `secretsmanager` (prefix `bedrock-agentcore`), `kms` (decrypt same-account), `s3`, `lambda`, `logs`, `xray`, `ecr`, `cloudwatch`. **Does NOT include `iam:CreateRole`.** In production replace with a custom least-privilege policy - the managed policy includes `GetWorkloadAccessTokenForUserId` which is unsafe in production.

ARN: `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess`

### Token Burndown Rate

Multiplicative factor with which output tokens consume TPM/TPD quota. For Claude 3.7 Sonnet and all later models (all Claude 4.x): **1 output token = 5 quota tokens**. For all other models: 1:1.

`max_tokens` is deducted from the TPM quota at request start (before generation completes); excess is returned at completion. Billing is on actual use only.

**Formula - initial quota reservation (at request start):**
```
InputTokenCount + CacheWriteInputTokens + (max_tokens × burndown_rate)
```
**Formula - final quota consumed (after completion):**
```
InputTokenCount + CacheWriteInputTokens + (OutputTokenCount × burndown_rate)
```
**Formula - billing:**
```
inputTokens (standard rate) + cacheWriteInputTokens (cache-write rate)
  + cacheReadInputTokens (reduced cache-read rate) + outputTokens (output rate)
```

### Prompt Caching and Cache Checkpoints

Optional feature that saves repeated prompt prefixes in cache (TTL 5 min or 1 hour for selected models). Defined via `cachePoint` (Converse API) or `cache_control` (InvokeModel Anthropic format).

- `CacheReadInputTokens` do **not** consume TPM quota.
- `CacheWriteInputTokens` **do** consume quota (together with `InputTokenCount`).
- `inputTokens` in the response represents only tokens that were neither cached nor written to cache.

**Models supporting TTL 1 hour:** Claude Opus 4.5, Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.5 **only**. Claude Sonnet 4.6 and Claude Opus 4.6 support **5 minutes only**. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-caching.html (supported models table)_

**Minimum tokens before a cache checkpoint:**
- Claude 3.7, Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4, Opus 4.1: **1024 tokens**
- Claude Opus 4.5, Opus 4.6, Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.5: **4096 tokens**

**Maximum cache checkpoints per request:** 4 for all supported Claude models.

### Intelligent Prompt Routing

Single serverless endpoint that predicts per-request which model in the same family (Anthropic, Meta, Amazon Nova) will yield the best quality/cost ratio. Used via a Prompt Router ARN. Supports default routers (pre-configured by AWS) and configured routers (customizable criteria). English prompts only.

### Cross-Region Inference Profiles

Two variants:
- **Geographic profiles** (`us.`, `eu.`, `au.`, `jp.` prefix) - routing stays within the specified geography, for data residency requirements. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-card-anthropic-claude-sonnet-4-6.html (Geo inference IDs listed as `us.`, `eu.`, `au.`, `jp.` - `apac.` is not a valid prefix)_
- **Global profiles** (`global.` prefix) - routes worldwide on the AWS backbone; ~10% cost saving confirmed for Claude Sonnet 4.5. No additional routing cost.

Data stays on the AWS network, encrypted in transit. Requests are logged in CloudTrail in the source region with `additionalEventData.inferenceRegion`.

Global inference uses `aws:RequestedRegion = 'unspecified'` for cross-region routing. The IAM policy for Global CRIS requires **three separate statements** (see [Code](#iam-policy-for-global-cross-region-inference)).

Available Global CRIS source regions (Claude Sonnet 4.x): `us-west-2`, `us-east-1`, `us-east-2`, `eu-west-1`, `ap-northeast-1`.

Global inference profile ID pattern: `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6`

### VPC Interface Endpoints (PrivateLink) for Bedrock

Five separate service endpoints plus two FIPS variants:

| Service name | Plane |
|---|---|
| `com.amazonaws.{region}.bedrock` | Control plane |
| `com.amazonaws.{region}.bedrock-runtime` | Runtime (inference) |
| `com.amazonaws.{region}.bedrock-mantle` | Mantle |
| `com.amazonaws.{region}.bedrock-agent` | Agent control plane |
| `com.amazonaws.{region}.bedrock-agent-runtime` | Agent runtime |
| `com.amazonaws.{region}.bedrock-fips` | Control plane (FIPS) |
| `com.amazonaws.{region}.bedrock-runtime-fips` | Runtime (FIPS) |

With private DNS enabled, no code changes are needed. Without private DNS, pass `endpoint_url` to the boto3 client.

### VPC Interface Endpoints (PrivateLink) for AgentCore

Three distinct endpoints:

| Service name | Covers |
|---|---|
| `com.amazonaws.{region}.bedrock-agentcore` | Data plane: Runtime, Memory, Built-in Tools, Identity, Gateway, Policy |
| `com.amazonaws.{region}.bedrock-agentcore-control` | Control plane: Runtime and Memory management |
| `com.amazonaws.{region}.bedrock-agentcore.gateway` | AgentCore Gateway (MCP tools) |

**Critical:** VPC endpoint policies cannot restrict OAuth callers - only SigV4. For OAuth callers the `Principal` must be `"*"` in the endpoint policy.

### KMS Customer Managed Key for Bedrock

The following artifacts support CMK encryption:

| Artifact | API parameter |
|---|---|
| Bedrock Agent | `customerEncryptionKeyArn` in `CreateAgent` |
| Knowledge base data source | `kmsKeyArn` in `CreateDataSource` |
| Custom model / fine-tuning job | `customModelKmsKeyId` in `CreateModelCustomizationJob` |
| Model evaluation job | `customerEncryptionKeyId` in `CreateEvaluationJob` |
| Vector stores (OpenSearch) | KMS key configured at vector store level |

Training/validation data on S3 uses SSE-KMS. Default encryption uses AWS-owned keys at no additional cost.

### MMDS in AgentCore

Analogous to EC2 IMDS. Any code running in the AgentCore microVM can read the execution role's temporary credentials from the MMDS endpoint. Therefore the execution role **must** be scoped to the strict minimum. Any tool code, prompt injection, or compromised dependency executing inside the microVM can exfiltrate these credentials.

### AgentCore Runtime Quotas

| Quota | Value | Adjustable |
|---|---|---|
| Active session workloads (US East N. Virginia / US West Oregon) | 1000 | Yes |
| Active session workloads (other regions) | 500 | Yes |
| Agent runtimes per account | 1000 | Yes |
| InvokeAgentRuntime TPS per agent | 25 | Yes |
| Hardware per session | 2 vCPU / 8 GB RAM | **No** |
| Sync request timeout | 15 minutes | **No** |
| Streaming request timeout | 60 minutes | No |
| Async job timeout | 8 hours | Configurable via `LifecycleConfiguration.maxLifetime` |
| Max payload | 100 MB | No |
| Max Docker image | 2 GB | No |
| Max direct-code package (compressed) | 250 MB | No |
| Max direct-code package (uncompressed) | 750 MB | No |

Supported regions: 16 regions including GovCloud (GA for Runtime, Memory, Gateway, Identity, Built-in Tools, Observability, Policy).

### Service Tiers

Four tiers available via the `serviceTier` parameter in runtime API calls:

| Tier | API value | Cost vs Standard | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reserved | `reserved` | Committed capacity pricing | Min 100K input TPM + 10K output TPM; 1 or 3 month commitment; 99.5% uptime target; contact AWS team |
| Priority | `priority` | Price premium - see the [Bedrock pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/) | No reservation needed |
| Standard | `default` | Baseline | Default if `serviceTier` is omitted |
| Flex | `flex` | Price discount - see the [Bedrock pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/) | Higher latency variability; on-demand quota shared with Priority/Standard |

On-demand quota is shared across Priority, Standard, and Flex. Reserved has a separate quota pool.

### Provisioned Throughput vs Batch Inference

**Provisioned Throughput:** Reserved capacity by the hour; required for custom models; no throttling within purchased Model Units. Pricing requires contacting the AWS team or querying the pricing API (not documented statically).

**Batch Inference:** Async job over S3; up to 10,000 records / 200 MB input file; 24-hour processing window; ~50% discount vs on-demand. **Does NOT support:** prompt caching, tool use, structured output, or multi-turn conversations. Not suitable for agentic workflows.

## Best practices

- **Use the trust policy with `aws:SourceAccount` + `aws:SourceArn` on ALL Bedrock and AgentCore execution roles** - Prevents the confused deputy attack: without these conditions, a malicious service could impersonate `bedrock.amazonaws.com` or `bedrock-agentcore.amazonaws.com` and assume your role with elevated privileges. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime-security-best-practices.html_

- **Do not use AgentCore CLI-generated policies in production** - CLI policies have broad scope (`resource: *`) for prototyping convenience. In production every statement must reference specific runtime ARNs, not wildcards. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime-security-best-practices.html_

- **In production (JWT always available): use `GetWorkloadAccessTokenForJWT` and explicitly deny `GetWorkloadAccessTokenForUserId`** - `GetWorkloadAccessTokenForUserId` accepts any opaque string without IdP verification, exposing the runtime to user impersonation. `GetWorkloadAccessTokenForJWT` validates the JWT signature, issuer, and expiry. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime-permissions.html_

- **Restrict `bedrock:InvokeModel` to the exact model ARN(s) required, never use `arn:aws:bedrock:*::foundation-model/*`** - The wildcard grants invocation of any model (including the most expensive ones). Specific ARNs prevent accidental cost escalation and block data exfiltration to unapproved models. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html_

- **Enable private DNS on Bedrock and AgentCore VPC endpoints; do NOT hardcode `endpoint_url` in code** - With private DNS enabled, code uses standard DNS names with no modifications. Hardcoding the `vpce-id`-based endpoint URL creates a runtime dependency that breaks portability. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/vpc-interface-endpoints.html_

- **For AgentCore VPC endpoints with OAuth: set `Principal: "*"` in the endpoint policy for actions that use Bearer Tokens** - VPC endpoint policies can only restrict SigV4 callers via IAM principals. OAuth calls only pass through if `Principal = "*"`. Without this, OAuth callers receive 403. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/vpc-interface-endpoints.html_

- **Reduce `max_tokens` to the approximate real completion size - never set 32768 "to be safe"** - `max_tokens` is deducted from the TPM quota at request start before any response is generated. An excessively high value reduces concurrent request capacity even if actual completions use few tokens. Calibrate using the CloudWatch `OutputTokenCount` metric. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/quotas-token-burndown.html_

- **Place cache checkpoints after static content (tools → system → messages) and before variable content** - Sections are processed in order: tools → system → messages. Modifying an upstream section invalidates the cache for all downstream sections. Variable content (user queries) must come AFTER the last checkpoint. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-caching.html_

- **Monitor `CacheReadInputTokens` and `CacheWriteInputTokens` via CloudWatch to measure prompt caching ROI** - Cache writes can cost more than standard input tokens on some models. Real savings depend on the read/write ratio. Without monitoring you may pay more rather than less. For Reserved tier, sum `InputTokenCount + CacheWriteInputTokens` to estimate capacity to reserve. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/quotas-token-burndown.html_

- **Use geographic inference profiles (`us.`, `eu.`, `au.`, `jp.`) when data residency is required; use global profiles for maximum throughput and ~10% cost reduction** - Geographic profiles guarantee data stays within the specified geography. Global profiles route across any AWS commercial region but only on the AWS backbone (never public internet) and offer ~10% savings (confirmed for Claude Sonnet 4.5). _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/cross-region-inference.html; geo prefixes confirmed at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-card-anthropic-claude-sonnet-4-6.html_

- **For Global cross-region inference IAM policy: include ALL THREE required statements** - Global CRIS requires three distinct resource ARNs: inference profile in the source region, FM in-region, and FM global (ARN without region or account). Missing even one causes `AccessDeniedException`. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/global-cross-region-inference.html_

- **Apply SCP at the Organization/OU level to restrict `bedrock:*` to approved regions, explicitly allowing `"unspecified"` for Global inference** - Without SCP, users/roles can invoke Bedrock models in non-compliant regions. SCPs are the only control that applies to child accounts. Global CRIS requests use `aws:RequestedRegion = "unspecified"` - an SCP blocking all unlisted regions must include `"unspecified"` in the exception or it blocks Global routing. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/data-perimeter-for-amazon-bedrock/regional-boundary-enforcement.html_

- **Start with `BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess` as a baseline, then create a customer-managed policy removing unused actions** - The managed policy is immediately available and reduces early errors, but it includes broad permissions (`GetWorkloadAccessTokenForUserId`, `iam:PassRole` on `*BedrockAgentCore*`). For production, copy only the needed statements. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html_

- **For VPC-mode agents, configure VPC endpoints for ECR (`dkr` + `api`), S3 (gateway), and CloudWatch Logs; restrict the S3 gateway policy to the ECR layer bucket only** - Without the S3 gateway endpoint, ECR image pulls transit through the NAT gateway incurring per-GB cost. The restricted policy prevents the endpoint from allowing access to any arbitrary S3 bucket. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime-security-best-practices.html_

- **For non-time-sensitive batch workloads, use batch inference instead of on-demand** - Batch inference costs approximately 50% less than on-demand and processes up to 10,000 records per job on S3. No throttling or quota management needed. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/capacity-limits-cost-optimization.html_

- **Use IAM Access Analyzer to validate policies before deploying to production** - Access Analyzer runs over 100 automatic checks on policy JSON and flags excessive permissions, unnecessary resource wildcards, and insecure patterns. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html_

- **For Reserved tier capacity planning, sum `InputTokenCount + CacheWriteInputTokens` (not just `InputTokenCount`) to estimate capacity to reserve** - The service-tiers documentation explicitly confirms that Reserved tier consumes both `InputTokenCount` and `CacheWriteInputTokens`. Underestimating leads to frequent overflow onto the Standard tier. _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/service-tiers-inference.html_

### VPC endpoint for Bedrock Runtime

Create the endpoint via AWS CLI and use it with boto3.

```bash
# Create the endpoint (private DNS enabled - recommended)
aws ec2 create-vpc-endpoint \
  --vpc-id vpc-0abcdef1234567890 \
  --service-name com.amazonaws.us-east-1.bedrock-runtime \
  --vpc-endpoint-type Interface \
  --subnet-ids subnet-0111aaa2222bbb333 \
  --security-group-ids sg-0aaabbbccc1111222 \
  --private-dns-enabled \
  --region us-east-1

# Repeat for other Bedrock service names if needed:
# com.amazonaws.us-east-1.bedrock
# com.amazonaws.us-east-1.bedrock-agent
# com.amazonaws.us-east-1.bedrock-agent-runtime

# boto3 with private DNS (no code change needed):
# import boto3
# client = boto3.client("bedrock-runtime", region_name="us-east-1")
# Automatically uses the VPC endpoint via private DNS

# boto3 WITHOUT private DNS (explicit endpoint_url):
python3 -c "
import boto3

# available via CloudWatch Metrics under ModelId and ServiceTier/ResolvedServiceTier
print(response["output"]["message"]["content"][0]["text"])
```

_Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.html - `serviceTier` is a top-level JSON body field (type: ServiceTier object with required `type` string); valid values: `priority | default | flex | reserved`.

## Gotchas

- **BURNDOWN RATE 5x FOR CLAUDE 3.7+ AND ALL CLAUDE 4.x:** 1 output token consumes 5 tokens from the TPM/TPD quota. A prompt with `max_tokens=32768` deducts 32,768 tokens from the TPM quota at the START of the request, even if the real response is 200 tokens. Overestimating `max_tokens` is the primary cause of premature throttling. Example: 1000 input + 100 output on Claude Sonnet 4.6 = 1,500 tokens consumed from quota (1000 + 100×5), but only 1,100 tokens are billed.

- **`CacheReadInputTokens` do NOT consume quota, but `CacheWriteInputTokens` DO:** Quota formula = `InputTokenCount + CacheWriteInputTokens + (OutputTokenCount × burndown)`. Tokens read from cache (`CacheReadInputTokens`) are not counted against TPM/TPD quotas. If the TTL expires frequently (continuous cache misses) you pay more than without caching because cache-write cost on some models is higher than the standard input token rate.

- **Bedrock does not support resource-based policies:** Unlike S3 or Lambda, `bedrock:InvokeModel` cannot be controlled via a resource policy on the model. All access logic is identity-based (policy on the caller) or via VPC endpoint policy.

- **`GetWorkloadAccessTokenForUserId` is dangerous in production:** It accepts any string as user-id without verifying identity with an IdP. A malicious actor with access to the runtime can impersonate any user-id. Use only in development; in production use `GetWorkloadAccessTokenForJWT`.

- **AgentCore CLI policies are for dev/test ONLY:** Permissions generated by the CLI have `"Resource": "*"` on many actions. Using them in production violates least-privilege and can expose the account to escalation.

- **MMDS exposes execution role credentials to any code in the microVM:** Any tool code, prompt injection, or compromised dependency running in the AgentCore microVM can call the MMDS endpoint and obtain the execution role's temporary credentials. Mitigation: keep the role scope at the strict minimum.

- **Changing tools invalidates ALL downstream cache:** Cache checkpoints in the Converse API are processed in order: tools → system → messages. Modifying a tool definition invalidates checkpoints for system and messages. Structure tools as static and user messages AFTER the last checkpoint.

- **Cross-region inference and SCPs:** Global inference profiles send requests with `aws:RequestedRegion = "unspecified"`. The SCP must explicitly allow `"unspecified"` in the list of permitted regions; otherwise Global CRIS requests are blocked even if the source region is whitelisted.

- **Batch inference does not support prompt caching, tool use, structured output, or multi-turn:** Do not use batch for agentic workflows that require these features.

- **Quota increases:** AWS prioritizes customers already consuming existing quotas. Requesting large increases before having real traffic may be rejected.

- **`iam:PassRole` in `BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess` is scoped to `*BedrockAgentCore*`:** If execution roles are named with a different pattern (e.g., `MyAgentRole`), `iam:PassRole` will fail silently. Use names containing `BedrockAgentCore` or create a custom policy with your own pattern.

- **TTL 1 hour is limited to Claude Opus 4.5, Haiku 4.5, and Sonnet 4.5.** The official `prompt-caching.html` supported-models table lists Claude **Sonnet 4.6 and Opus 4.6 as `5 minutes` only** (not 1 hour). Specifying `"ttl": "1h"` on an unsupported model is silently ignored (inference still succeeds at 5m). _Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-caching.html_

- **CORRECTION - AgentCore VPC endpoint is NOT a single endpoint:** You need THREE separate endpoints: `bedrock-agentcore` (data plane), `bedrock-agentcore-control` (control plane), `bedrock-agentcore.gateway` (Gateway). Create only the ones relevant to the operations you intend to perform.

- **RPM (requests per minute) is no longer enforced:** The RPM quota on `bedrock-runtime` has been officially deprecated. Throttling is governed ONLY by token-based quotas (TPM and TPD). Do not request RPM increases for `bedrock-runtime`.

- **AgentCore Harness and Payments maturity/Region availability changed after this June baseline.** Re-check `freshness-2026-08.md`, release notes, and Region tables before production use.

- **Global cross-region inference for Bedrock requires an IAM policy with THREE statements:** One for the inference profile in the source region, one for the FM in-region, one for the FM global (ARN without region or account). Missing even one causes `AccessDeniedException`.

- **For Reserved tier, include `CacheWriteInputTokens` in capacity estimation:** The Reserved tier consumes `InputTokenCount + CacheWriteInputTokens`. Sizing only on `InputTokenCount` leads to frequent overflow onto the Standard tier.

## Verify live (open questions)

Re-check the following in the live console or docs before relying on them in production code:

1. **Exact prices ($/MTok) for cache read vs cache write vs standard input for Claude 4.x models** (Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6, Opus 4.5, Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4, etc.): The [Amazon Bedrock pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/) renders these only via interactive JavaScript - they cannot be extracted statically. The only statically confirmed price pair is Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 (extended access): input $6.00, output $30.00, cache write $7.50, cache read $0.60 per 1M tokens. For all current Anthropic models consult the pricing section in the AWS console directly.

2. **Exact default quota values per model** (e.g., default TPM for Claude Sonnet 4.6 in us-east-1): These change frequently and are not documented statically. Verify in the [Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/bedrock/quotas) or via `aws service-quotas list-service-quotas --service-code bedrock`.

3. **Provisioned Throughput pricing per model** (cost per Model Unit per hour): Requires contacting the AWS team or querying the pricing API. Not available in static documentation.
